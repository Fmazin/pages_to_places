# pages_to_places

This repo is part of the Master's Thesis "*From Pages to Places: Using Large Language Models to Extract PERSON-PLACE Relations from Wikipedia Articles*" by Fabian Fermazin. This is done as part of the [MSc Transport and Geoinformation Technology](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/transport-and-geoinformation-technology/) program at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm. It includes 100 biography texts sourced from Wikipedia and the main dataset including all PERSON-PLACE relations and their components. It also enriched with geographic information about the spatial entities.

The main use for this repo is to develop, train, evaluate and compare extraction of PERSON-PLACE relations. Also feel free to e.g.expand and investigate the relations themselves.
