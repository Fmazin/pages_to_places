[1]Na Hye-sŏk (Korean: 나혜석, 28 April 1896 – 10 December 1948) was a Korean feminist, poet, writer, painter, educator, and journalist.
[2]Na Hye-sok art name was Jeongwol (정월, 晶月).
[3]Na Hye-sok was a pioneering Korean feminist writer and painter.
[4]Na Hye-sok was the first female professional painter and the first feminist writer in Korea.
[5]Na Hye-sok created some of the earliest Western-style paintings in Korea, and published feminist novels and short stories.
[6]Na Hye-sok became well known as a feminist because of Na Hye-sok's criticism of the marital institution in the early 20th century.
[7]


== Early life ==
Na Hye-sok was born in 1896 in Suwon.
[8]Na Hye-sok was the fourth child of father Na Gi-jeong and mother Choi Si-ui, and a member of the aristocratic Naju Na clan.
[9]Na Hye-sok demonstrated Na Hye-sok's artistic talent from an early age and graduated at the top of Na Hye-sok's class at Jinmyeong Girl's High School in 1913.
[10]


== Career ==

[11]As a young woman, Na Hye-sok was known for Na Hye-sok's high spirits and outspokenness, making it clear Na Hye-sok wanted to be a painter and an intellectual, rejecting the traditional "Good Wife, Wise Mother" archetype.
[12]Na Hye-sok major written work, Kyonghui (경희), published in 1918, concerns a woman's self-discovery and her subsequent search for meaning in life as a "new woman."
[13]


[14]After Na Hye-sok's graduation from Jinmyeong Girls' High School in 1913, Na Hye-sok majored in Western oil painting at Tokyo Arts College for Women.
[15]As a student, Na Hye-sok wrote several essays critiquing the standard "good wife, good mother" Korean archetype, saying Na Hye-sok wanted a career as an artist.
[16]In April 1915, Na Hye-sok became the main organizer of the Association of Korean Women Students in Japan.
[17]It was around this time that Na Hye-sok fell in love with Choe Sung-gu, a student at Keio University and the then editor and publisher of the magazine Hakchigwang.
[18]The relationship between Na Hye-sok and Choe was highly publicized among Korean students in Japan, as was Na Hye-sok close literary and personal association with Yi Gwangsu.
[19]In the spring of 1915, Na Hye-sok father summoned Na Hye-sok's back home and pressured Na Hye-sok's to accept a marriage proposal from a well-established family.
[20]Na Hye-sok was able to escape this by accepting a teaching position in a primary school, according to Na Hye-sok's later account.
[21]After a year of teaching and saving money for tuition, Na Hye-sok returned to Tokyo toward the end of 1915 to resume Na Hye-sok's studies.
[22]In April 1916, however, Choe Sung-gu died of tuberculosis, and Na Hye-sok had to temporarily stop Na Hye-sok's studies while recovering from a mental breakdown.
[23]

[24]In 1919, Na Hye-sok participated in the March 1st Movement against Japanese rule.
[25]Na Hye-sok was jailed for this.
[26]In 1920 Na Hye-sok  along with Kim Iryeop and ten men, participated the coterie literary magazine Pyeho.
[27]Early in the 1920s, both Kim and Na Hye-sok contributed a series of articles to the first magazine for Korean women, called Sinyoja, or "New Woman", on the subject of improving Korean women's clothing.
[28]They argued for a more functional and practical outfit for Korean women to help improve their hygiene, health, and self-image, and denounced traditional Korean dresses which were designed with no consideration for women's physical comfort, protection, and convenience.
[29]On April 10, 1920, Na Hye-sok married Kim Woo-young, in Jeongdong wedding hall, Seoul.
[30]On 18 March 1921, Na Hye-sok had Na Hye-sok's first exhibition of paintings and the first exhibition by a Korean woman painter in Seoul.
[31] 
[32]In 1923, Na Hye-sok attracted much attention for Na Hye-sok's essay "Thoughts on becoming a mother," in which Na Hye-sok lashed out against Na Hye-sok's husband for leaving child-rearing entirely up to Na Hye-sok's 
[33]In 1927 Na Hye-sok and Na Hye-sok's husband went on a tour of Europe and America sponsored by the Japanese government.
[34]Following Na Hye-sok's return from abroad, Na Hye-sok continued Na Hye-sok's art career, holding an exhibition in Na Hye-sok's home town of Suwon in which Na Hye-sok displayed both the art that completed in Europe as well as prints Na Hye-sok had acquired throughout Na Hye-sok's travels.
[35]

[36]Na Hye-sok studied painting in France.
[37] While in Paris, with Na Hye-sok's husband away, Na Hye-sok is said to have engaged in an affair with Cheondo-gyo leader Choi Rin, which became fodder for gossip columnists.
[38]Na Hye-sok husband divorced Na Hye-sok's on grounds of infidelity in 1931.
[39]Despite the divorce and disgraceful reputation, Na Hye-sok continued painting and won a special prize at the 10th Joseon Art Exhibition in 1931.
[40]Na Hye-sok also published a piece called A Divorce Testimony in the magazine Samcheolli in 1934, raising issues with gender inequality endorsed by Korean morality and tradition.
[41]Na Hye-sok challenged the patriarchal social system and male-oriented mentality of Korean society at the time.
[42]In A Divorce Testimony, Na Hye-sok criticized the repression of female sexuality; stated that Na Hye-sok's ex-husband had been unable to satisfy Na Hye-sok's sexually and refused to discuss the issue; and finally Na Hye-sok advocated "test marriages" where a couple would live together before marrying to avoid a repeat of Na Hye-sok's unhappy marriage.
[43]It was A Divorce Testimony that ultimately ruined Na Hye-sok career, as Na Hye-sok's views were regarded as scandalous and shocking, since traditional Korean Confucian culture considered premarital sex to be taboo and women were not to speak frankly of their sexuality.
[44]Na Hye-sok died on December 10, 1948, at a charity hospital.
[45]Na Hye-sok has recently been acknowledged in Korea for Na Hye-sok's artistic and literary accomplishments.
[46]For example, Seoul Arts Center opened a retrospective exhibition of Na Hye-sok's works in 2000.
[47]


== Artistic style and career
[48]==
Art historian Sunglim Kim writes how, in 1926 Na Hye-sok described that Na Hye-sok's painting style was “influenced by Na Hye-sok's Japanese professors.”
[49]This resulted in a "Post-Impressionist and Naturalist style" which emphasized form, color, and lighting.
[50]In order to bring a more personal differentiation to Na Hye-sok's work, Na Hye-sok style underwent a shift from brighter, prominent colors to ones that were less vibrant.
[51]Other characteristics of Na Hye-sok personal style include: a “specialty in landscape”; “bold, confident, and spontaneous brushstrokes”, and experimentation with texture, exemplified in South Gate of Bonghwan Fortress (1923).
[52] 
[53]An additional description of Na Hye-sok's work by Sunglim Kim explains that Na Hye-sok's environment had a clear influence on the depictions in Na Hye-sok's work, stating,  “Because Na Hye-sok went out to sketch for Na Hye-sok's landscapes and gave deep thought to composition, Na Hye-sok's presentation of architectural structure and Na Hye-sok's compositions are well considered and solid.”During this period, Na Hye-sok participated in many exhibitions, displaying and selling Na Hye-sok's work, some of which sold for as much as 350 won (US $3,500 today).
[54]Na Hye-sok first solo exhibition, which included a collection of oil paintings, was promoted in a newspaper article Kyonsong ilbo.
[55]Na Hye-sok also submitted paintings almost yearly to the state-sponsored Joseon Art Exhibition.
[56]Many of Na Hye-sok's paintings were accepted into the Joseon Art Exhibition.
[57]Two of Na Hye-sok's paintings, Garden in Fall and Nangrang Tomb, won fourth and third place, respectively.
[58]Additionally, two of Na Hye-sok's paintings, Ch’onhung (Tianhou Temple) and Garden received the “...highest award in Western oil painting…” in 1926 and 1931, respectively.
[59]In the 1930s, Na Hye-sok received criticism of Na Hye-sok's work as well as of Na Hye-sok's personal life after Na Hye-sok's affair became known to the public.
[60]As a result, Na Hye-sok moved to submitting works to a Japanese art exhibition, Teiten, as well as requesting help in selling Na Hye-sok's work.
[61]This was not enough, however, and Na Hye-sok no longer submitted work to public exhibitions.
[62]These issues all took their toll on Na Hye-sok  which was attributed to another shift in Na Hye-sok's artistic style, “with loose structure and rough hasty brushstrokes” exemplified in Peonies in Front of Hwanyong Hall (1933) and Hongnyu Waterfall (1937).

Although Na Hye-sok is remembered primarily for Na Hye-sok's literary work on early feminism, Na Hye-sok has also impacted modern Korean art through several known pieces that reflect both Na Hye-sok's beliefs on gender roles as well as Na Hye-sok's life's trajectory.
[64]The most famous of these works is Na Hye-sok's Self-Portrait (자화상), c. 1928.
[65]It is difficult to find any likeness to Korean or female conformity in Na Hye-sok self-portrait.
[66]In this oil painting, Na Hye-sok emphasizes Na Hye-sok's identity as a modern, educated, independent woman by wearing modern clothing instead of a traditional Korean hanbok, which was at the time worn as everyday clothing in Korea.
[67]Additionally, Na Hye-sok's hairstyle is also modernized; Na Hye-sok's hair in the painting has been "styled" into soft waves with two buns in the back, which was a popular feminine hairstyle in the West in the 1920s.
[68]Na Hye-sok make-up is also more westernized, with harsh contour, heavy blush, the shape of the eyebrow is arched and shaded darkly with a dark brown to black coloring.
[69]

[70]The dark palette of the background blends with Na Hye-sok hair and dress to create a flat surface for Na Hye-sok's face to stand out, drawing viewers’ eyes to Na Hye-sok's expression.
[71]The carved and partially shadowed face, the dark, deep eyes, and the slightly pressed and pursed mouth convey weariness and agony.
[72]In addition to these qualities, Na Hye-sok's large eyes and high nose bridge are reminiscent of western features.
[73]The influence of Cubism is clear in the prominent Westernized facial bone structure of Na Hye-sok  this could imply a preferred appearance or a wish to understand the Western woman’s experience of living in a more progressive society.
[74]Despite the fact that Na Hye-sok looks both western and modern in terms of appearance and attire, the darkness in this painting's coloring (black, silver, brown, peach) shows how Na Hye-sok was still stuck within a society where conservative ideas were holding women back from achieving real and significant social changes.
[75]


[76]The depressing look Na Hye-sok dons in the painting indicates the hardship of living as a New Woman in a patriarchal and complicated society of early 20th century Korea; Na Hye-sok's firm, straight gaze points to Na Hye-sok's conviction in Na Hye-sok's ideals.
[77]Na Hye-sok is also gazing somewhere else rather than directly at the viewer, which could represent how the freedom and fluidity in gender roles Na Hye-sok was seeking was unable to be found in the conservative society Na Hye-sok was living in.
[78]

[79]In 2000, Seoul Arts Center opened a retrospective exhibition of Na Hye-sok's works, and in 2022, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) displayed this self-portrait as part of its Korean contemporary art exhibition, titled “The Space Between: The Modern in Korean Art."
[80]BTS’s RM introduced it along with the nine other pieces through an audio message spoken in both English and Korean, a testament to how influential and respected Na Hye-sok is nowadays for Na Hye-sok's art.
[81]

[82]A similar painting by Na Hye-sok is titled Dancers (c. 1927 – 1928) and depicts two apparently western women wearing brown and white fur coats.
[83]It is clear that the two women are western or at least meant to portray western women based on their facial features, which are drawn in a similar way to the features that appear on Na Hye-sok's own self-portrait (e.g. high nose bridges and heavy makeup).
[84]This painting evokes an image of luxury and sophistication through the way the women are elegantly posed, indicating that it is unlikely that the fur coats were worn solely out of necessity for the frosty weather.
[85]The title of the painting Dancers also adds to this imagery, suggesting that this attire is meant for aesthetic purposes instead.
[86]The presentation of the women is associated with Western society and modernity, and this influence from the West is present throughout most of Na Hye-sok's paintings.
[87]The darker color scheme Na Hye-sok uses in this painting is similar to that of Self-Portrait (i.e. brown tones) and is used in much of Na Hye-sok's other work as well, reflecting both the tragic life Na Hye-sok lived as well as Na Hye-sok's mental state at the time.
[88]

Another work of art Na Hye-sok is attributed with is the painting Peonies at Hwaryeongjeon (화령전 작약).
[89]Na Hye-sok range of topics for Na Hye-sok's paintings is vast, and these topics range from farm life, nudes, and satires to different types of scenery.
[90]This painting was created after Na Hye-sok released A Divorce Confession (otherwise known as A Divorce Testimony) in 1934, Na Hye-sok's extremely controversial piece of writing that criticized gender roles as well as Na Hye-sok's husband's behavior in their marriage.
[91]Although both Na Hye-sok and Na Hye-sok's husband committed faults in their relationship, Na Hye-sok lost more than Na Hye-sok's husband and eventually became a social outcast after releasing this work.
[92]This painting was made just a year after this incident, reflecting Na Hye-sok's hope to be free from social restrictions.
[93]Na Hye-sok uses the impasto painting technique in this work, which is a style in which visible brushstrokes of thick paint are used to create clear paint streaks on top of the canvas.
[94]By doing so, Na Hye-sok is able to capture the fleeting moments when the wind blows the peonies to a blur in the foreground.
[95]The texture and the appearance of movement in the painting evoke a realistic experience of a windy excursion and the vibrant colors (orange, green, yellow, and white) make the painting appear animated and lively.
[96]Both of these qualities are symbolic of the freedom Na Hye-sok seeks as a woman in 20th-century conservative Korean society.
[97]
More recently, another landscape painting created by Na Hye-sok has been unveiled.
[98]The drawing was found at Na Hye-sok's nephew Na Sanggyun’s house in Buam-dong, northern Seoul.
[99]According to Na Sanggyun, the painting had belonged to the granddaughter of Choi Nam-seon, a renowned writer during the Japanese colonial period.
[100]Choi Namseon and Na Hye-sok had been acquaintances ever since they studied together in Japan.
[101]Na Hye-sok gave the drawing to him, and it had been preserved through three generations.
[102]


[103]The drawing is estimated to have been made in 1928 during Na Hye-sok stay in Paris as part of Na Hye-sok's 21-month trip around the world with Na Hye-sok's husband.
[104]The painting is 60 centimeters long (24 inches) and 50 centimeters wide and depicts a typical landscape painting of a French village with surrounding trees and a red-roofed house with white walls.
[105]The bold brush strokes in the work simplify the object while also bringing it to life, and elements of Fauvinism and expressionism can also be found in it.
[106]
The artwork was recognized by Kim Yi-sun, a professor of Korean modern art at Hongik University, to be from Na Hye-sok collection book.
[107]The piece was confirmed to be Na Hye-sok due to a signature 'HR' found on it that Na Hye-sok used regularly in Na Hye-sok's works as a form of identification.
[108]

[109]Some other paintings potentially created by Na Hye-sok during Na Hye-sok's stay in Europe include Harbor in Spain and Beach in Spain.
[110]These pieces differ from Na Hye-sok Paris landscape painting through the colorful presentation of the scenes depicted, with the varied use of bright colors such as green, orange, brown, blue, and white in the fluid strokes that outline the details of the scenes.
[111]Interestingly, Na Hye-sok Scene of Paris (1927-1928), also created during this time, uses more subdued colors (e.g. brown and grayish tones) that appear to make the scene more depressing and dark.
[112]This artistic choice establishes a mood more closely related to that of Na Hye-sok's Paris landscape painting, which may suggest that Na Hye-sok viewed Na Hye-sok's time in France differently in comparison to the time Na Hye-sok spent in the other European nations, possibly due to Na Hye-sok's affair in Paris with Choi Rin at the time.
[113]



[114]== Appreciation ==
Na Hye-sok short story Kyunghui (경희, 1918) is regarded as a work that shows Na Hye-sok's distinct femininity.
[115]Na Hye-sok novel work was a confession novel.
[116]It was also the trend of the novels of the 1920s-1930s.
[117]Similar confessionary novels by writers such as Yeom Sang-seop, Kim Dong-in, Kim Iryeop, and Kim Myeong-sun challenged the sexual taboo based on the traditional patriarchal family system.
