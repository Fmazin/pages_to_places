[1]Philetaerus (; Ancient Greek: Φιλέταιρος, Philétairos, c. 343 –263 BC) was the founder of the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon in Anatolia.

== Early life and career under Lysimachus =
[3]=
Philetaerus was born in Tieium (Greek: Tieion), a small town on the Black Sea coast in Anatolia.
[4]Philetaerus father Attalus (Greek: Attalos) was Greek and Philetaerus's mother Boa was from Paphlagonia.
[5]After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Philetaerus became involved in the Wars of the Diadochi among Alexander's regional governors, Antigonus in Phrygia, Lysimachus in Thrace, and Seleucus in Babylonia (among others).
[6]Philetaerus first served under Antigonus.
[7]Philetaerus then shifted Philetaerus's allegiance to Lysimachus, who, after Antigonus was killed at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, made Philetaerus commander of Pergamon, where Lysimachus kept a treasury of nine thousand talents of silver.

[9]== Ruler of Pergamon ==
Philetaerus served Lysimachus until 282 BC, when, perhaps because of conflicts involving the court intrigues of Arsinoë, Lysimachus' third wife, Philetaerus deserted Lysimachus, offering Philetaerus and the important fortress of Pergamon, along with its treasury, to Seleucus, who subsequently defeated and killed Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC.
[10]Seleucus himself was killed by Ptolemy Ceraunus, a brother of Arsinoë at Lysimachia a few months later.
[11]Though nominally under Seleucid control, Philetaerus  especially after the death of Seleucus, had considerable autonomy and was able with the help of Philetaerus's considerable wealth to increase Philetaerus's power and influence beyond Pergamon.
[12]There are numerous records of Philetaerus as benefactor to neighboring cities and temples, including the temples at Delphi and Delos.
[13]Philetaerus also contributed troops, money and food to the city of Cyzicus for defense against the invading Gauls.
[14]As a result, Philetaerus gained prestige and goodwill for Philetaerus and Philetaerus's family.
[15]During Philetaerus's nearly forty year rule, Philetaerus constructed the temple of Demeter on the acropolis of Pergamon, and the temple of Athena (Pergamon's patron deity), and Pergamon's first palace, and Philetaerus added considerably to the city's fortifications.
[16]Philetaerus was a eunuch, though scholars differ on the reason for Philetaerus's castration.
[17] 
[18]Attalus I, the first Attalid king of Pergamon, explained that when Philetaerus was a baby, Philetaerus was brought into a crowd where Philetaerus was pressed upon and Philetaerus's testicles were crushed.

"
[19]Philetaerus  was a eunuch from boyhood; for it came to pass at a certain burial, when a spectacle was being given at which many people were present, that the nurse who was carrying Philetaerus  still an infant, was caught in the crowd and pressed so hard that Philetaerus was incapacitated.
[20]Philetaerus was a eunuch, therefore, but Philetaerus was well trained and proved worthy of this trust.
[21]"Philetaerus never married and, since Philetaerus was a eunuch, had no children.
[22]Philetaerus adopted Philetaerus's nephew Eumenes I (the son of Philetaerus brother also named Eumenes), who succeeded Philetaerus as ruler of Pergamon, upon Philetaerus's death in 263 BC.
[23]

[24]With the exception of Eumenes II, all future Attalid rulers depicted the bust of Philetaerus on their coins, paying tribute to Philetaerus
