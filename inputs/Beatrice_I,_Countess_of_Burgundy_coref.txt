[9]


=== Wedding ===
Frederick I likely suggested the marriage because the County of Burgundy would give him an alternative to the Brenner Pass and a strategically valuable position against Milan, and because of the additional troops of Burgundian knights available for his war.

Minerva did not have Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's brilliant mind

There never was another except God's mother Mary
And Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy is so happy Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy excels her.

After their marriage, Frederick took control of the County of Burgundy by the right of Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy and became Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's co-ruler.
[17]Although formally co-rulers, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy name was seldom included in the charters managing the affairs of Burgundy before the year of 1166, after which more charters were issued in the name of both Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy and Frederick as joint rulers of Burgundy.
[18]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy actual involvement in the rule of Burgundy is unknown.
[19] Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy younger son Otto was named the heir to Burgundy, rather than Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's elder son.
[20]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy accompanied Frederick on his travels and campaigns across his empire.
[21]A legend states that in 1158 Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy visited Milan where was just conquered by Frederick, but was taken captive in a sally by the enraged Milanese and forced to ride backwards through the city on a donkey in a humiliating manner until getting out.
[22]Some sources of this legend indicate that Barbarossa implemented his revenge for this insult by forcing the magistrates of the city to remove a fig from the anus of a donkey using only their teeth.
[23]Another source states that Barbarossa took his wrath upon every able-bodied man in the city, and that it was not a fig they were forced to hold in their mouth, but excrement from the donkey.
[24]To add to this debasement, they were made to announce, "Ecco la fica" (meaning "behold the fig"), with the feces still in their mouths.
[25]It used to be said that the insulting gesture (called fico), of holding one's fist with the thumb in between the middle and forefinger came by its origin from this event.
[26]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy at least once played a role in warfare: during the Siege of Crema in July 1159, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was able to provide the emperor with badly needed reinforcements from Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's own county of Burgundy, and arrived to Crema on 20 July of that year in the company of Henry the Lion, archbishop Conrad of Augsburg and 1,200 knights, providing him with the reinforcements he needed.

[30]In 1162, Italian chronicler Acerbo Morena, having seen Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy at Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's hometown Lodi, said of Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy that Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was: 

"of medium height, with shining golden hair, a most beautiful face, and white, well shaped teeth; Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's posture was upright, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's mouth small, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's countenance modest, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's eyes sparkled; Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was bashful when charming and flattering words was addressed to Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's  Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy had most beautiful hands and a slender figure; Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was completely submissive to Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's husband, feared him as Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's lord and loved him in every way as Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's husband; Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was literate and devoted to God; and just as Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was named Beatrix, so Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was in fact happy ['Beata']".
[31]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was crowned Holy Roman Empress by Antipope Paschal III in Rome on 1 August 1167, after Frederick took Rome.
[32]Then there was a plague in the army.
[33]When retreating, the emperor and empress were attacked by their enemies at Pontremoli.
[34]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy armed Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy with two shields and could hardly escape the arrow rain.
[35]It is also said that Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy held a single shield and a sword in self-defense at then.
[36]After they reached Pavia, they were attacked again.
[37]The emperor having escaped, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy stayed in hostile Susa until 1168, presumably imprisoned until permitted to depart, while there is no detailed record of how Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was treated during this period.
[38]

[39]During the disputed Cambrai episcopal election of 1168, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy supported the election of bishop Peter of Cambrai and at his request successfully blocked the attempt of the archbishop Philip to transfer the bishopric of Cambrai from the metropolitan province of Riems to Cologne, supported by archbishop Christian of Mainz and Henry the Lion.
[40]The relationship between Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy and Frederick is traditionally described as happy, and there is nothing to indicate that he was ever unfaithful to Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's 
[41]The English chronicler Ralph of Diceto noted about their relationship, that "Although Frederick was always most constant in adversity, he was nevertheless reputed by many to be uxurious... and seeking how to please Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's in all things."
[42]There is no information about Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's dower or economy, but it is noted that the recipients of Imperial favors and all individuals who were restored to favor were required to give not only Frederick himself but also Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy personal gifts, many of which are recorded,  as well as shares of gifts in gold and silver given to the emperor.
[43]Archbishop Conrad II of Salzburg promised money and gifts in hope that Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy would help him regain imperial favor through mediation.
[44]For all the five times Frederick set expeditions to Italy, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was still with the army, but staying in cities rather than barracks, for Frederick wanted to keep Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's away from murder and violence.

[51]After the Peace of Venice of 1177, according to the treaty, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy would no longer be referred to as Imperatrix ('empress') in the chancery productions, as Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's coronation as such had been made by an anti-pope and was thus declared nullified.
[52]The peace treaty also stipulated that if Frederick died and young Prince Henry succeeded to the throne with the empire actually ruled by Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy  Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's son should still observe it.
[53]There is no record about the actual implementation of this provision.
[54]On 30 July 1178, Frederick was crowned king of Burgundy in Arles in Provence.
[55]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was present, but Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was not crowned with him.
[56]On 15 August 1178, however, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was crowned queen of Burgundy in Vienne.
[57]The reason as to why Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was crowned in Vienne is unknown: it is speculated that this was made as a compensation because the Peace of Venice had formally nullified Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's coronation as empress, as it had been performed by an anti-pope, but it could also have been to signal Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's new role as that of resident ruling Palatine Countess of Burgundy, as Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy seems to have stayed to govern Burgundy from this year forward rather than continue to follow Frederick.
[58]The event signified a change in the life of Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy

[60] 
[61]Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy is confirmed to have visited Germany on only three occasions after this: at feast of St Peter and Paul in 1179, and at the Pentecost courts of 1182 and 1184.
[62]Instead, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy seems to have stayed in Burgundy, for the first time governing the county by Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy  there are extant charters of Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's own before 1181, but nine between that year and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's death, all of them concerning Burgundian affairs.
[63]Many of Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's Burgundian charters were witnessed by Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's younger son Otto, who was Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's designated heir to Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's own title, Count Palatine of Burgundy, and his teacher, who was evidently there with Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's 
[64]This was in fact an effective separation from Frederick, a reason for the discord hinted in the fact that Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy  in contrast to Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's spouse, continued to refer to Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy as empress in Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy's charters.
[65]Living in the Middle Ages with strict hierarchy, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy was not indifferent to fame and wealth; like other contemporary empresses, Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy had strict view of hierarchy and valued reputation.
