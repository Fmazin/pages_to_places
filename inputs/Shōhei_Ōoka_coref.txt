[2]Shōhei Ōoka belongs to the group of postwar writers whose Pacific War experiences at home and abroad figure prominently in their works.
[3]Over Shōhei Ōoka's lifetime, Shōhei Ōoka contributed short stories and critical essays to almost every literary magazine in Japan.

== Early life ==
Shōhei Ōoka was born in the ward of Ushigome in Tokyo (now part of Shinjuku) to parents from Wakayama Prefecture.
[5]Shōhei Ōoka father was a stockbroker and Shōhei Ōoka's mother was a geisha.
[6]Raised to study literature from early childhood, Shōhei Ōoka mastered French while in high school.
[7]Shōhei Ōoka parents also hired the famed literary critic Kobayashi Hideo to be Shōhei Ōoka's tutor.
[8]Under Kobayashi's instruction, Shōhei Ōoka made the acquaintance of poet Nakahara Chūya, the critic Kawakami Tetsutaro, and others who would become well known literary figures.
[9]Shōhei Ōoka entered Kyoto Imperial University School of Literature in April 1929, graduating in March 1932.
[10]

[11]After graduation, Shōhei Ōoka became a journalist with the Kokumin Shimbun, a pro-government newspaper, but quit after one year to devote Shōhei Ōoka to the study and translation of the works of Stendhal and other European writers into Japanese.
[12]In 1938, to support Shōhei Ōoka  Shōhei Ōoka found a job as a translator with Air Liquide (Teikoku Sansō), a Franco-Japanese industrial company based in Kobe.
[13]In June 1943, Shōhei Ōoka left their employ, and in November of the same year obtained a position at Kawasaki Heavy Industries.
[14]
However, in 1944, Shōhei Ōoka was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army, given only three months of rudimentary training and sent to the front line at Mindoro Island in the Philippines, where Shōhei Ōoka served as Shōhei Ōoka's battalion's communications technician until Shōhei Ōoka's battalion was routed and numerous men killed.
[15]In January 1945, Shōhei Ōoka was captured by American forces and sent to a prisoner of war camp on Leyte Island.
[16]Survival was very traumatic for Ōoka, who was troubled that he, a middle-aged and, to Shōhei Ōoka's way of thinking, unworthy soldier, had survived when so many others had not.
[17]Shōhei Ōoka returned to Japan at the end of the year and lived at Akashi, Hyōgo.

It was not until Shōhei Ōoka's repatriation after the war's end that Shōhei Ōoka began Shōhei Ōoka's career as a writer.  On the recommendation of Shōhei Ōoka's childhood French tutor and mentor Kobayashi Hideo, Shōhei Ōoka published an autobiographical short-story of Shōhei Ōoka's experiences as a prisoner of war entitled Furyoki (俘虜記, lit. 'Account of a Prisoner of War'), published in English as Taken Captive: A Japanese POW's Story, in three separate parts between 1948 and 1951.
[22]Its publication, along with winning the Yokomitsu Riichi Prize in 1949, encouraged Shōhei Ōoka to take up writing as a career.
[23]
Shōhei Ōoka next work, Musashino Fujin, (武蔵野夫人, "A Wife in Musashino", 1950), is a psychological novel patterned after the works of Stendhal.
[24]

[25]Shōhei Ōoka best-known novel, Nobi (野火, Fires on the Plain, 1951), was also well received by critics, and won the prestigious Yomiuri Prize in 1951.
[26]Considered one of the most important novels of the postwar period and based loosely on Shōhei Ōoka's own wartime experiences in the Philippines, Nobi explores the meaning of human existence through the struggle for survival of men who are driven by starvation to cannibalism.
[27]It was subsequently made into a prize-winning film by Ichikawa Kon in 1959, although the film substantially changes the protagonist's relationship to the theme of cannibalism and Christianity.
[28]

[29]In 1958, Shōhei Ōoka veered from Shōhei Ōoka's usual subjects and produced Kaei (花影, "The Shade of Blossoms", 1958–1959), depicting an aging, naive nightclub hostess’s struggle and ultimate demise from the destructive forces of desire and wealth in the decadent 1950s Ginza.
[30]The setting had changed but the recurring themes had not.
[31]Shōhei Ōoka characters were still adrift and struggling for survival in an inhospitable environment.
[32] Kaei won the Shinchosha Literary Prize in 1961.
[33]

[35] 
[36]Shōhei Ōoka compiled and researched an enormous amount of information for three years in order to produce it.
[37]As with all Shōhei Ōoka's writing, it looks at war critically from the perspective of a person who, despite ethical reservations, was forced to serve.
[38]The novel won the Mainichi Art Award.
[39]
Shōhei Ōoka was invited to become a member of the Japan Art Academy in November 1971 but declined to join, partly, Shōhei Ōoka said, on account of Shōhei Ōoka's former experience of soldier and prisoner of war.
[40]

[41]Along with translations and fiction, Shōhei Ōoka also devoted Shōhei Ōoka to writing the critical biographies of Tominaga Taro and Nakahara Chūya, which won the Noma Literary Prize in 1974.
