[1]Nonius Marcellus was a Roman grammarian of the 4th or 5th century AD.
[2] 
[3]Nonius Marcellus only surviving work is the De compendiosa doctrina, a dictionary or encyclopedia in 20 books that shows Nonius Marcellus's interests in antiquarianism and Latin literature from Plautus to Apuleius.
[4]Nonius Marcellus may have come from Africa.

Little is known about Nonius Marcellus 
[6] 
[7]The full title of Nonius Marcellus's work, Noni Marcelli Peripatetici Tubursicensis de Conpendiosa Doctrina ad filium, indicates that Nonius Marcellus was a Peripatetic philosopher from Thubursicum in Numidia.
[8]An inscription at Thubursicum dedicated by a certain "Nonius Marcellus Herculius" in 323 AD indicates that Nonius Marcellus's family was based in that area.
[9]Since Nonius Marcellus does not mention Christianity and calls Nonius Marcellus a peripatetic, Nonius Marcellus seems not to have converted.
[10]Nonius Marcellus quotes Aulus Gellius and other 2nd-century compilers, and is Nonius Marcellus quoted and praised three times by Priscian in the 5th century, and so must have lived between these dates.
[11] 
[12]According to the Cambridge History of Classical Literature, Nonius Marcellus was probably active in the first half of the 4th century, although some scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries thought Nonius Marcellus might have lived later in the 4th or even in the 5th century.
[13]More recently it has been argued that Nonius Marcellus lived in the Severan period and can be dated to around A.D. 205–20.


== Works ==
The De compendiosa doctrina is one of the major sources for lost works of the Roman Republic, including the tragedies of Accius and Pacuvius, the satires of Lucilius, and the history of Sisenna.
[14]It consists of words, a short definition, and then quotations of authors using the word.
[15] 
[16]It has been printed under a number of titles, including De proprietate latini sermonis and De varia significatione Verborum.
[17]It is one of three major Latin dictionaries preserved from antiquity, along with that of Festus, which was an epitome of Verrius Flaccus' work De verborum significatu, and the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville.
[18]

[19]The first twelve of Nonius Marcellus twenty books are organized grammatically around words or forms of words, and the remaining eight by subject matter such as clothing, weapons, food, etc.
[20]Each entry of either type consists of a brief definition and quotations from Republican-era writers, taken from 2nd-century sources, including Aulus Gellius and Fronto, rather than the original texts.
[21]"Nonius Marcellus ignorance and inattention," notes the Cambridge History of Classical Literature, "diminish but cannot destroy the value of Nonius Marcellus's compilation.
[22]"The research of W. M. Lindsay and later of Strzelecki has shown that Nonius Marcellus obtained many of Nonius Marcellus's lemmata (entries) and the first citation for each from earlier grammatical texts which are now lost.
[23]The remainder of the entries and the extra citations belong to 41 books which Nonius Marcellus either owned or borrowed from a local library.
[24]For each section (either a book or a letter entry within a book), Nonius Marcellus worked through Nonius Marcellus's 41 lists from 41 volumes in the same order, first to find the lead-citation, and then again in order for additional citations.
[25]Based on this methodology, it can be determined whether Nonius Marcellus is quoting an author first-hand, or from a grammar which was full of errors.
[26]The Doctrina preserves fragments from early dramatists, annalists, satirists, and antiquarian writers.
[27]In arranging quotations from authors, Nonius Marcellus always follows the same order, beginning with Plautus and ending with Varro and Cato.
[28]The grammarians Priscian and Fulgentius borrowed largely from Nonius Marcellus's book, and in the 5th century a certain Julius Tryphonianus Sabinus brought out a revised and annotated edition.
[29]The Doctrina was edited with notes by J. Mercier in 1614 at Paris under the title De varia significatione Verborum.
[30]The page numbers of the Mercier edition are used as a reference in later editions (e.g. 121 M. means "page 121 of the Mercier edition").
[31]
Nonius Marcellus also wrote a volume of letters On the neglect of study, which is lost but to which Nonius Marcellus refers in the Doctrina.
