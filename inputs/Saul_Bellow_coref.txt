[3]Saul Bellow is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times, and Saul Bellow received the National Book Foundation's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990.In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee
[4], Saul Bellow's writing exhibited

the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.

Saul Bellow best-known works include The Adventures of Augie March, Henderson the Rain King, Herzog, Mr. Sammler's Planet, Seize the Day, Humboldt's Gift, and Ravelstein.

[5]Saul Bellow said that of all Saul Bellow's characters, Eugene Henderson, of Henderson the Rain King, was the one most like Saul Bellow 
[6]Saul Bellow grew up as an immigrant from Quebec.
[7]As Christopher Hitchens describes it, Saul Bellow fiction and principal characters reflect Saul Bellow's own yearning for transcendence, a battle "to overcome not just ghetto conditions but also ghetto psychoses."
[8]Saul Bellow protagonists wrestle with what Albert Corde, the dean in The Dean's December, called "the big-scale insanities of the 20th century."
[9]This transcendence of the "unutterably dismal" (a phrase from Dangling Man) is achieved, if it can be achieved at all, through a "ferocious assimilation of learning" (Hitchens) and an emphasis on nobility.

[99]James Wood, in a eulogy of Saul Bellow in The New Republic, wrote:
I judged all modern prose by Saul Bellow's 
[100]Unfair, certainly, because Saul Bellow made even the fleet-footed—the Updikes, the DeLillos, the Roths—seem like monopodes.
[101]Yet what else could I do?
[102]I discovered Saul Bellow prose in my late teens, and henceforth, the relationship had the quality of a love affair about which one could not keep silent.
[103]Over the last week, much has been said about Saul Bellow prose, and most of the praise—perhaps because it has been overwhelmingly by men—has tended toward the robust
[104]: We hear about Saul Bellow mixing of high and low registers, Saul Bellow's Melvillean cadences jostling the jivey Yiddish rhythms, the great teeming democracy of the big novels, the crooks and frauds and intellectuals who loudly people the brilliant sensorium of the fiction.
[105]All of this is true enough; John Cheever, in his journals, lamented that, alongside Saul Bellow fiction, his stories seemed like mere suburban splinters.
[106]Ian McEwan wisely suggested last week that British writers and critics may have been attracted to Saul Bellow precisely because Saul Bellow kept alive a Dickensian amplitude now lacking in the English novel. ...
[107]But nobody mentioned the beauty of this writing, its music, its high lyricism, its firm but luxurious pleasure in language itself.
[108]...
[109][I]n truth, I could not thank Saul Bellow enough when Saul Bellow was alive, and I cannot now.

[117]



[118]==
[119]Themes and style =
[120]=

[121]Saul Bellow themes include the disorientation of contemporary society, and the ability of people to overcome their frailty and achieve greatness or awareness.
[122]Saul Bellow saw many flaws in modern civilization, and its ability to foster madness, materialism and misleading knowledge.
[123]Principal characters in Saul Bellow fiction have heroic potential, and many times they stand in contrast to the negative forces of society.
[124]Often these characters are Jewish and have a sense of alienation or otherness.
[125]
Jewish life and identity is a major theme in Saul Bellow work, although Saul Bellow bristled at being called a "Jewish writer".
[126]Saul Bellow work also shows a great appreciation of America, and a fascination with the uniqueness and vibrancy of the American experience.
[127]

[128]Saul Bellow work abounds in references and quotes from Marcel Proust and Henry James, among others, but Saul Bellow offsets these high-culture references with jokes.
[129]Saul Bellow interspersed autobiographical elements into Saul Bellow's fiction, and many of Saul Bellow's principal characters were said to bear a resemblance to Saul Bellow 
[130]


== Assessment ==
Martin Amis described Saul Bellow as "The greatest American author ever, in my view".
[131]
 
[132]Saul Bellow sentences seem to weigh more than anyone else's.
[133]Saul Bellow is like a force of nature ...
[134]Saul Bellow breaks all the rules ...
[135][T]he people in Saul Bellow fiction are real people, yet the intensity of the gaze that Saul Bellow bathes them in, somehow through the particular, opens up into the universal.
[136]

[137]For Linda Grant, "What Saul Bellow had to tell us in Saul Bellow's fiction was that it was worth it, being alive."

Saul Bellow vigour, vitality, humour and passion were always matched by the insistence on thought, not the predigested cliches of the mass media or of those on the left, which had begun to disgust Saul Bellow by the Sixties ...
[138]It's easy to be a 'writer of conscience'—anyone can do it if they want to; just choose your cause.
[139]Saul Bellow was a writer about conscience and consciousness, forever conflicted by the competing demands of the great cities, the individual's urge to survival against all odds and his equal need for love and some kind of penetrating understanding of what there was of significance beyond all the racket and racketeering.
[140]

[141]On the other hand, Saul Bellow detractors considered Saul Bellow's work conventional and old-fashioned, as if Saul Bellow were trying to revive the 19th-century European novel.
[142]In a private letter, Vladimir Nabokov described Saul Bellow as a "miserable mediocrity".
[143]Journalist and author Ron Rosenbaum described Saul Bellow Ravelstein (2000) as the only book that rose above Saul Bellow failings as an author.
[144]Rosenbaum wrote,

 My problem with the pre-Ravelstein Bellow is that Saul Bellow all too often strains too hard to yoke together two somewhat contradictory aspects of Saul Bellow's being and style.
[145]There's the street-wise Windy City wiseguy and then—as if to show off that the wiseguy has Wisdom—there are the undigested chunks of arcane, not entirely impressive, philosophic thought and speculation.
[146]Just to make sure you know Saul Bellow's novels have intellectual heft.
[147]That the world and the flesh in Saul Bellow's prose are both figured and transfigured
[148].
[149]
Kingsley Amis, father of Martin Amis, was less impressed by Saul Bellow 
[150]In 1971, Kingsley suggested that crime writer John D. MacDonald "is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow .
[151]Sam Tanenhaus wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 2007:

But what, then, of the many defects—the longueurs and digressions, the lectures on anthroposophy and religion, the arcane reading lists?
[152]What
[153]of
[154]the characters who don't change or grow but simply bristle onto the page, even the colorful lowlifes pontificating like fevered students in the seminars Saul Bellow taught at the University of Chicago?
[155]And what of the punitively caricatured ex-wives drawn from the teeming annals of Saul Bellow own marital discord?
[156]

[157]But Tanenhaus went on to answer his question:

Shortcomings, to be sure.
[158]But so what?
[159]Nature doesn't owe us perfection.
[160]Novelists don't either.
[161]Who among us would even recognize perfection if we saw it?
[162]In any event, applying critical methods, of whatever sort, seemed futile in the case of Saul Bellow '
[163]

[164]V. S. Pritchett praised Saul Bellow  finding Saul Bellow's shorter works to be Saul Bellow's best.
[165]Pritchett called Saul Bellow novella Seize the Day a "small gray masterpiece."


==
[166]Political views ==
As Saul Bellow grew older, Saul Bellow moved decidedly away from leftist politics and became identified with cultural conservatism.
[167]Saul Bellow opponents included feminism, campus activism and postmodernism.
[168]Saul Bellow also thrust Saul Bellow into the often contentious realm of Jewish and African-American relations.
[169]Saul Bellow was critical of multiculturalism and according to Alfred Kazin once said: "Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus?
[170]The Proust of the Papuans?
[171]Saul Bellow d be glad to read him."
[172]Saul Bellow distanced Saul Bellow somewhat from these remarks, which Saul Bellow characterized as "off the cuff obviously and pedantic certainly."
[173]Saul Bellow  however, stood by Saul Bellow's criticism of multiculturalism, writing:

In any reasonably open society, the absurdity of a petty thought-police campaign provoked by the inane magnification of "discriminatory" remarks about the Papuans and the Zulus would be laughed at.
[174]To be serious in this fanatical style is a sort of Stalinism – the Stalinist seriousness and fidelity to the party line that senior citizens like me remember all too well.
[175]

[176]Despite Saul Bellow's identification with Chicago, Saul Bellow kept aloof from some of that city's more conventional writers.
[177]In a 2006 interview with Stop Smiling magazine, Studs Terkel said of Saul Bellow  "I didn't know Saul Bellow too well.
[178]We disagreed on a number of things politically.
[179]In the protests in the beginning of Norman Mailer's Armies of the Night, when Mailer, Robert Lowell and Paul Goodman were marching to protest the Vietnam War, Saul Bellow was invited to a sort of counter-gathering.
[180]Saul Bellow said, 'Of course Saul Bellow ll attend'.
[181]But Saul Bellow made a big thing of it.
[182]Instead of just saying OK, Saul Bellow was proud of it.
[183]So I wrote Saul Bellow a letter and Saul Bellow didn't like it.
[184]Saul Bellow wrote me a letter back.
[185]Saul Bellow called me a Stalinist.
[186]But otherwise, we were friendly.
[187]Saul Bellow was a brilliant writer, of course.
[188]I love Seize the Day."
[189]

[190]Attempts to name a street after Saul Bellow in Saul Bellow's Hyde Park neighborhood were halted by a local alderman on the grounds that Saul Bellow had made remarks about the neighborhood's inhabitants that they considered racist.
[191]A one-block stretch of West Augusta Boulevard in Humboldt Park was named Saul Bellow Way in Saul Bellow's honor instead.
[192]Saul Bellow was a supporter of U.S. English, an organization formed in the early 1980s by John Tanton and former Senator S. I. Hayakawa, that supports making English the official language of the United States, but ended Saul Bellow's association with the group in 1988.
