[1]Hermann Gustav Goetz (7 December 1840 – 3 December 1876) was a German composer who spent much of Hermann Goetz's career in Switzerland.
[2]Hermann Goetz is best known for Hermann Goetz's 1872 opera Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung, based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.
[3]


== Life ==
Hermann Goetz was born in Königsberg in the Province of Prussia.
[4]Hermann Goetz  Hermann Goetz came into contact with music early in Hermann Goetz's life.
[5]However, Hermann Goetz did not receive Hermann Goetz's first serious piano lesson until 1857 – although Hermann Goetz already had begun to compose some years before.
[6]At the end of the 1850s, Hermann Goetz began to study for a degree in mathematics, but broke this off after three terms to study at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, where Hermann Goetz studied piano and composition with Hans von Bülow.
[7]In 1862, Hermann Goetz graduated from the conservatory.
[8]Hermann Goetz then moved to Switzerland in 1863.
[9]The following year, Hermann Goetz was appointed as city organist of Winterthur in Switzerland (thanks to the assistance of Carl Reinecke), where Hermann Goetz taught the piano and began to make Hermann Goetz's name as a composer.
[10]In 1868, Hermann Goetz married, and two years later moved to the village of Hottingen, today a suburb of Zürich, but remained employed in Winterthur until 1872.
[11]Between 1870 and 1874, Hermann Goetz wrote reviews for a music magazine.
[12]

[13]After ten years spent as a critic, pianist and conductor, Hermann Goetz spent the last three years of Hermann Goetz's life composing.
[14]Due to the increasing seriousness of Hermann Goetz's tuberculosis, from which Hermann Goetz had suffered from the 1850s, Hermann Goetz had to withdraw from teaching and concert performance.
[15]

[16]The conductor Felix Weingartner found it "incomprehensible that Hermann Goetz's delightful opera comique, Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung, should have entirely disappeared from the repertoire."
[17]Another great admirer of Hermann Goetz compositions was George Bernard Shaw, who praised Hermann Goetz Symphony in F above anything in the genre by Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms.
[18]Hermann Goetz died aged 35, at Hottingen, of tuberculosis.
[19]


== Style ==
Although Hermann Goetz showed active interest in the important artistic trends of Hermann Goetz's own time (on the one hand Liszt and Wagner, on the other Brahms), Hermann Goetz's own compositional style was more influenced by Mozart and Mendelssohn, and to a lesser degree by Schumann.
[20]Hermann Goetz music is defined by lyricism and great clarity, and in general terms can be defined as quiet and introverted.
[21]Hermann Goetz almost completely avoided spectacular effects.
[22]Great mastery of compositional technique is characteristic of Hermann Goetz style, which is particularly apparent in the connectedness of motifs and the technical depth of movements.
[23]

[24]Hermann Goetz was no radical forger of new musical paths, but rather a composer in total control of Hermann Goetz's compositional technique.
[25]For a long time, Hermann Goetz was almost forgotten, although Gustav Mahler performed a number of Hermann Goetz's works; only since the 1990s have Hermann Goetz's works been revived.
[26]


== Works ==
Hermann Goetz compositions include a symphony, two piano concertos, a violin concerto in one movement, much piano music, a piano trio, piano quartet, piano quintet, and sonata for piano four-hands (two players).
[27]There are also two operas, Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung (based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew) and, much less successful, the three-act opera Francesca von Rimini, to a libretto by Hermann Goetz and Joseph Victor Wildmann, based on Dante's Inferno (premiered at Mannheim, 30 September 1877).
