[1]John Muir ( MURE; April 21, 1838 – December 24, 1914), also known as "John of the Mountains" and "Father of the National Parks", was a Scottish-born American: 42  naturalist, author, environmental philosopher, botanist, zoologist, glaciologist, and early advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States.
[2]

[3]John Muir books, letters and essays describing John Muir's adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada, have been read by millions.
[4]John Muir activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley and Sequoia National Park, and John Muir's example has served as an inspiration for the preservation of many other wilderness areas.
[5]The Sierra Club, which John Muir co-founded, is a prominent American conservation organization.
[7]As part of the campaign to make Yosemite a national park, John Muir published two landmark articles on wilderness preservation in The Century Magazine, "The Treasures of the Yosemite" and "Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park"; this helped support the push for US Congress to pass a bill in 1890 establishing Yosemite National Park.
[8]The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in John Muir's writings has inspired readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas.
[9]John Muir has been considered "an inspiration to both Scots and Americans".
[10]John Muir biographer, Steven J. Holmes, believes that John Muir has become "one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity", both political and recreational.
[11]As a result, John Muir's writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and John Muir has often been quoted by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams.
[12]"John Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world", writes Holmes.
[13]John Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and environmental advocate, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for many people, making John Muir's name "almost ubiquitous" in the modern environmental consciousness.
[14]According to author William Anderson, John Muir exemplified "the archetype of our oneness with the earth", while biographer Donald Worster says John Muir believed John Muir's mission was "saving the American soul from total surrender to materialism".

== Early life ==


=== Boyhood in Scotland ===
John Muir Birthplace is a four-story stone house in Dunbar, Scotland.
[19]John Muir parents were Daniel Muir and Ann Gilrye.
[20]John Muir was the third of eight children: Margaret, Sarah, David, Daniel, Ann and Mary (twins), and the American-born Joanna.
[21]John Muir earliest recollections were of taking short walks with John Muir's grandfather when John Muir was three.
[22]In John Muir's autobiography, John Muir described John Muir's boyhood pursuits, which included fighting, either by re-enacting romantic battles from the Wars of Scottish Independence or just wrestling on the playground, and hunting for birds' nests (ostensibly to one-up John Muir's fellows as they compared notes on who knew where the most were located).
[23]:
[24] 25, 37
[25]  
[26]Author Amy Marquis notes that John Muir began John Muir's "love affair" with nature while young, and implies that it may have been in reaction to John Muir's strict religious upbringing.
[27]"John Muir father believed that anything that distracted from Bible studies was frivolous and punishable."
[28]But John Muir was a "restless spirit" and especially "prone to lashings".
[29]As a young boy, John Muir became fascinated with the East Lothian landscape, and spent a lot of time wandering the local coastline and countryside.
[30]It was during this time that John Muir became interested in natural history and the works of Scottish naturalist Alexander Wilson.
[31]
Although John Muir spent the majority of John Muir's life in America, John Muir never forgot John Muir's roots in Scotland.
[32]John Muir held a strong connection with John Muir's birthplace and Scottish identity throughout John Muir's life and was frequently heard talking about John Muir's childhood spent amid the East Lothian countryside.
[33]John Muir greatly admired the works of Thomas Carlyle and poetry of Robert Burns; John Muir was known to carry a collection of poems by Burns during John Muir's travels through the American wilderness.
[34]John Muir returned to Scotland on a trip in 1893, where John Muir met one of John Muir's Dunbar schoolmates and visited the places of John Muir's youth that were etched in John Muir's memory.
[35]John Muir never lost John Muir's Scottish accent since John Muir was already 11 years old when John Muir and John Muir's family emigrated to America.
[36]



[37]=== Immigration to America ===
In 1849, John Muir family immigrated to the United States, starting a farm near Portage, Wisconsin, called Fountain Lake Farm.
[38]It has been designated a National Historic Landmark.
[39]Stephen Fox recounts that John Muir father found the Church of Scotland insufficiently strict in faith and practice, leading to their immigration and joining a congregation of the Campbellite Restoration Movement, called the Disciples of Christ.
[40]: 7  By the age of 11, John Muir had learned to recite "by heart and by sore flesh" all of the New Testament and most of the Old Testament.
[41]: 30
[42]  
[43]In maturity, while remaining a deeply spiritual man, John Muir may have changed John Muir's orthodox beliefs.
[44]John Muir wrote, "John Muir never tried to abandon creeds or code of civilization; they went away of their own accord ... without leaving any consciousness of loss."
[45]Elsewhere in John Muir's writings, John Muir described the conventional image of a Creator "as purely a manufactured article as any puppet of a half-penny theater".
[46]: 95,
[47] 115
[48] 
When John Muir was 22 years old, John Muir enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, paying John Muir's own way for several years.
[49]There, under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall, John Muir took John Muir's first botany lesson.
[50]A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree and used it to explain how the grand locust is a member of the pea family, related to the straggling pea plant.
[51]Fifty years later, John Muir described the day in John Muir's autobiography.
[52]"This fine lesson charmed John Muir and sent John Muir flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm".: 225
[53]  
[54]As a freshman, John Muir studied chemistry with Professor Ezra Carr and his wife Jeanne; they became lifelong friends and John Muir developed a lasting interest in chemistry and the sciences.: 76  John Muir took an eclectic approach to John Muir's studies, attending classes for two years but never being listed higher than a first-year student due to John Muir's unusual selection of courses.
[55]Records showed John Muir's class status as "irregular gent" and, even though John Muir never graduated, John Muir learned enough geology and botany to inform John Muir's later wanderings.
[56]: 36
[57] 
[58]In 1863, John Muir's brother Daniel left Wisconsin and moved to Southern Ontario (then known as Canada West in the United Canadas), to avoid the draft during the US Civil War.
[59]John Muir left school and travelled to the same region in 1864, and spent the spring, summer, and fall exploring the woods and swamps, and collecting plants around the southern reaches of Lake Huron's Georgian Bay.
[60]:
[61] 85, 92
[62]  John Muir hiked along the Niagara Escarpment, including much of today's Bruce Trail.
[63]With John Muir's money running low and winter coming, John Muir reunited with John Muir's brother Daniel near Meaford, Ontario, who persuaded John Muir to work with him at the sawmill and rake factory of William Trout and Charles Jay.
[64]John Muir lived with the Trout family in an area called Trout Hollow, south of Meaford, on the Bighead River.
[65]While there, John Muir continued "botanizing", exploring the escarpment and bogs, collecting and cataloging plants.
[66]One source appears to indicate John Muir worked at the mill/factory until the summer of 1865,: 37
[67]  while another says John Muir stayed on at Trout Hollow until after a fire burned it down in February 1866. In March 1866, John Muir returned to the United States, settling in Indianapolis to work in a wagon wheel factory.
[68]John Muir proved valuable to John Muir's employers because of John Muir's inventiveness in improving the machines and processes; John Muir was promoted to supervisor, being paid $25 per week.: 48
[69]  
[70]In early-March 1867, an accident changed the course of John Muir's life: a tool John Muir was using slipped and struck John Muir in the eye.
[71]The file slipped and cut the cornea in John Muir's right eye and then John Muir's left eye sympathetically failed.
[72]John Muir was confined to a darkened room for six weeks to regain John Muir's sight, worried about whether John Muir would end up blind.
[73]When John Muir regained John Muir's sight, "John Muir saw the world—and John Muir's purpose—in a new light".
[74]John Muir later wrote, "This affliction has driven John Muir to the sweet fields.
[75]God has to nearly kill us sometimes, to teach us lessons".
[76]From that point on, John Muir determined to "be true to [John Muir " and follow John Muir's dream of exploration and study of plants.: 97
[77] 

[78]In September 1867, John Muir undertook a walk of about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from Kentucky to Florida, which John Muir recounted in John Muir's book A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf.
[79]John Muir had no specific route chosen, except to go by the "wildest, leafiest, and least trodden way John Muir could find".
[80]When John Muir arrived at Cedar Key, John Muir began working for Richard Hodgson at Hodgson's sawmill.
[81]However, three days after accepting the job at Hodgson's, John Muir almost died of a malarial sickness.
[82]After spending three months in an oft delirious state, John Muir condition improved to such that John Muir was able to move about the Hodgson's house and look outside.
[83]Due to their unending kindness in caring for John Muir's life, John Muir stated that John Muir "doubtless owe John Muir life" to the Hodgsons.
[84]

[85]One evening in early January 1868, John Muir climbed onto the Hodgson house roof to watch the sunset.
[86]John Muir saw a ship, the Island Belle, and learned it would soon be sailing for Cuba.

[91]  
[92]John Muir boarded the ship, and while in Havana, John Muir spent John Muir's hours studying shells and flowers and visiting the botanical garden in the city.
[93]: 56
[94]  
[95]Afterwards, John Muir sailed to New York City and booked passage to California.: 40–41  In 1878, John Muir served as a guide and artist for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey on the survey of the 39th parallel across the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah.

=== California ===


==== Experiencing Yosemite ====
Finally settling in San Francisco, John Muir immediately left for a week-long visit to Yosemite, a place John Muir had only read about.
[98]Seeing it for the first time, John Muir notes that "John Muir was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces to get a closer look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower."
[99]John Muir later returned to Yosemite and worked as a shepherd for a season.
[100]John Muir climbed a number of mountains, including Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana, and hiked an old trail down Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake.
[101]

[102]John Muir built a small cabin along Yosemite Creek,: 207  designing it so that a section of the stream flowed through a corner of the room so John Muir could enjoy the sound of running water.
[103]John Muir lived in the cabin for two years: 143  and wrote about this period in John Muir's book First Summer in the Sierra (1911).
[104]John Muir biographer, Frederick Turner, notes John Muir journal entry upon first visiting the valley and writes that John Muir's description "blazes from the page with the authentic force of a conversion experience".
[105]: 172 


====
[106]Friendships
[107]=
[108]=
[109]==
During these years in Yosemite, John Muir was unmarried, often unemployed, with no prospects for a career, and had "periods of anguish", writes naturalist author John Tallmadge.
[110]John Muir did marry in 1880 to Louisa Strentzel.
[111]John Muir went into business for 10 years with John Muir's father-in-law managing the orchards on the family 2600 acre farm in Martinez, California.
[112]John Muir and Louisa had two daughters, Wanda Muir Hanna and Helen Muir Funk.
[113]John Muir was sustained by the natural environment and by reading the essays of naturalist author Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote about the very life that John Muir was then living.
[114]On excursions into the back country of Yosemite, John Muir traveled alone, carrying "only a tin cup, a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, and a copy of Emerson.": 52–53  John Muir usually spent John Muir's evenings sitting by a campfire in John Muir's overcoat, reading Emerson under the stars.
[115]As the years passed, John Muir became a "fixture in the valley", respected for John Muir's knowledge of natural history, John Muir's skill as a guide, and John Muir's vivid storytelling.
[116]:
[117] 53
[118]  
[119]Visitors to the valley often included scientists, artists, and celebrities, many of whom made a point of meeting with John Muir 
John Muir maintained a close friendship for 38 years with William Keith, a California landscape painter.
[120]They were both born the same year in Scotland and shared a love for the mountains of California.
[121]In 1871, after John Muir had lived in Yosemite for three years, Emerson, with several friends and family, arrived in Yosemite during a tour of the Western United States.
[122]: 105–46  The two men met, and according to Tallmadge, "Emerson was delighted to find at the end of his career John Muir ...
[123]And for John Muir  Emerson's visit came like a laying on of hands."
[124]: 53  
[125]Emerson spent one day with John Muir  and he offered John Muir a teaching position at Harvard, which John Muir declined.
[126]John Muir later wrote, "John Muir never for a moment thought of giving up God's big show for a mere profship!"
[127]:
[128] John Muir also spent time with photographer Carleton Watkins and studied his photographs of Yosemite.


==== Geological studies and theories ====
Pursuit of John Muir's love of science, especially geology, often occupied John Muir's free time.
[129]John Muir soon became convinced that glaciers had sculpted many of the features of the Yosemite Valley and surrounding area.
[130]This notion was in strong contradiction to the accepted contemporary theory, promulgated by Josiah Whitney (head of the California Geological Survey), which attributed the formation of the valley to a catastrophic earthquake.
[131]As John Muir ideas spread, Whitney tried to discredit John Muir by branding John Muir as an amateur.
[132]But Louis Agassiz, the premier geologist of the day, saw merit in John Muir ideas and lauded John Muir as "the first man I have ever found who has any adequate conception of glacial action".
[133]
In 1871, John Muir discovered an active alpine glacier below Merced Peak, which helped John Muir's theories gain acceptance.
[134]
A large earthquake centered near Lone Pine in Owens Valley strongly shook occupants of Yosemite Valley in March 1872.
[135]The quake woke John Muir in the early morning, and John Muir ran out of John Muir's cabin "both glad and frightened", exclaiming, "A noble earthquake!"
[136]Other valley settlers, who believed Whitney's ideas, feared that the quake was a prelude to a cataclysmic deepening of the valley.
[137]John Muir had no such fear and promptly made a moonlit survey of new talus piles created by earthquake-triggered rockslides.
[138]This event led more people to believe in John Muir ideas about the formation of the valley.
[139]



[140]====
[141]Botanical studies ====
In addition to John Muir's geologic studies, John Muir also investigated the plant life of the Yosemite area.
[142]In 1873 and 1874, John Muir made field studies along the western flank of the Sierra on the distribution and ecology of isolated groves of Giant Sequoia.
[143]In 1876, the American Association for the Advancement of Science published John Muir paper on the subject.
[144]



[145]=== Pacific Northwest ===
John Muir made four trips to Alaska, as far as Unalaska and Barrow.
[146]John Muir  Mr. Young (Fort Wrangell missionary) and a group of Native American Guides first traveled to Alaska in 1879 and were the first Euro-Americans to explore Glacier Bay.
[147]Muir Glacier was later named after John Muir 
[148]John Muir traveled into British Columbia a third of the way up the Stikine River, likening its Grand Canyon to "a Yosemite that was a hundred miles long".
[149]John Muir recorded over 300 glaciers along the river's course.
[150]John Muir returned for further explorations in southeast Alaska in 1880 and in 1881 was with the party that landed on Wrangel Island on the USS Corwin and claimed that island for the United States.
[151]John Muir documented this experience in journal entries and newspaper articles—later compiled and edited into John Muir's book The Cruise of the Corwin.
[152]In 1888 after seven years of managing the Strentzel fruit ranch in Alhambra Valley, California, John Muir's health began to suffer.
[153]John Muir returned to the hills to recover, climbing Mount Rainier in Washington and writing Ascent of Mount Rainier.

=== Preservation efforts ===


==== Establishing Yosemite National Park =
[159]===
John Muir threw John Muir into the preservationist role with great vigor.
[160]John Muir envisioned the Yosemite area and the Sierra as pristine lands.
[161]John Muir thought the greatest threat to the Yosemite area and the Sierra was domesticated livestock—especially domestic sheep, which John Muir referred to as "hoofed locusts".
[162]In June 1889, the influential associate editor of The Century magazine, Robert Underwood Johnson, camped with John Muir in Tuolumne Meadows and saw firsthand the damage a large flock of sheep had done to the grassland.
[163]Johnson agreed to publish any article John Muir wrote on the subject of excluding livestock from the Sierra high country.
[164]He also agreed to use his influence to introduce a bill to Congress to make the Yosemite area into a national park, modeled after Yellowstone National Park.
[165]

[166]On September 30, 1890, the US Congress passed a bill that essentially followed recommendations that John Muir had suggested in two Century articles, "The Treasures of the Yosemite" and "Features of the Proposed National Park", both published in 1890.
[167]But to John Muir dismay, the bill left Yosemite Valley under state control, as it had been since the 1860s.
[168]



[169]=== Co-founding the Sierra Club ===

In early 1892, Professor Henry Senger, a philologist at the University of California, Berkeley, contacted John Muir with the idea of forming a local 'alpine club' for mountain lovers.
[170]Senger and San Francisco attorney Warren Olney sent out invitations "for the purpose of forming a 'Sierra Club'.
[171]John Muir will preside".
[172]On May 28, 1892, the first meeting of the Sierra Club was held to write articles of incorporation.
[173]One week later John Muir was elected president, Warren Olney was elected vice-president, and a board of directors was chosen that included David Starr Jordan, president of the new Stanford University.
[174]John Muir remained president until John Muir's death 22 years later.: 107–108 The Sierra Club immediately opposed efforts to reduce Yosemite National Park by half, and began holding educational and scientific meetings.
[175]At one meeting in the fall of 1895 that included John Muir  Joseph LeConte, and William R. Dudley, the Sierra Club discussed the idea of establishing 'national forest reservations', which were later called National Forests.
[176]The Sierra Club was active in the successful campaign to transfer Yosemite National Park from state to federal control in 1906.
[177]The fight to preserve Hetch Hetchy Valley was also taken up by the Sierra Club, with some prominent San Francisco members opposing the fight.
[178]Eventually a vote was held that overwhelmingly put the Sierra Club behind the opposition to Hetch Hetchy Dam.
[179]


=== Preservation vs conservation ===
In July 1896, John Muir became associated with Gifford Pinchot, a national leader in the conservation movement.
[180]Pinchot was the first head of the United States Forest Service and a leading spokesman for the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of the people.
[181]His views eventually clashed with John Muir and highlighted two diverging views of the use of the country's natural resources.
[182]Pinchot saw conservation as a means of managing the nation's natural resources for long-term sustainable commercial use.
[183]As a professional forester, his view was that "forestry is tree farming", without destroying the long-term viability of the forests.
[184]John Muir valued nature for its spiritual and transcendental qualities.
[185]In one essay about the National Parks, John Muir referred to them as "places for rest, inspiration, and prayers."
[186]John Muir often encouraged city dwellers to experience nature for its spiritual nourishment.
[187]Both men opposed reckless exploitation of natural resources, including clear-cutting of forests.
[188]John Muir acknowledged the need for timber and the forests to provide it, but Pinchot's view of wilderness management was more resource-oriented.
[189]Their friendship ended late in the summer of 1897 when Pinchot released a statement to a Seattle newspaper supporting sheep grazing in forest reserves.
[190]John Muir confronted Pinchot and demanded an explanation.
[191]When Pinchot reiterated his position, John Muir told him: "John Muir don't want any thing more to do with you".
[192]This philosophical divide soon expanded and split the conservation movement into two camps: the "preservationists", led by John Muir  and Pinchot's camp, who used the term "conservation".
[193]The two men debated their positions in popular magazines, such as Outlook, Harper's Weekly, Atlantic Monthly, World's Work, and Century.
[194]Their contrasting views were highlighted again when the United States was deciding whether to dam Hetch Hetchy Valley.
[195]Pinchot favored damming the valley as "the highest possible use which could be made of it".
[196]In contrast, John Muir proclaimed, "Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the hearts of man".
[197]

[198]In 1899, John Muir accompanied railroad executive E. H. Harriman and esteemed scientists on the famous exploratory voyage along the Alaska coast aboard the luxuriously refitted 250-foot (76 m) steamer, the George W. Elder.
[199]John Muir later relied on John Muir's friendship with Harriman to pressure Congress to pass conservation legislation.
[200]In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt accompanied John Muir on a visit to Yosemite.
[201]John Muir joined Roosevelt in Oakland, California, for the train trip to Raymond.
[202]The presidential entourage then traveled by stagecoach into the park.
[203]While traveling to the park, John Muir told the president about state mismanagement of the valley and rampant exploitation of the valley's resources.
[204]Even before they entered the park, John Muir was able to convince Roosevelt that the best way to protect the valley was through federal control and management.
[205]

[206]After entering the park and seeing the magnificent splendor of the valley, the president asked John Muir to show him the real Yosemite.
[207]John Muir and Roosevelt set off largely by themselves and camped in the back country.
[208]The duo talked late into the night, slept in the brisk open air of Glacier Point, and were dusted by a fresh snowfall in the morning.
[209]It was a night Roosevelt never forgot.
[210]He later told a crowd, "Lying out at night under those giant Sequoias was like lying in a temple built by no hand of man, a temple grander than any human architect could by any possibility build."
[211]John Muir  too, cherished the camping trip.
[212]"Camping with the President was a remarkable experience", John Muir wrote.
[213]"John Muir fairly fell in love with him".
[214]John Muir then increased efforts by the Sierra Club to consolidate park management.
[215]In 1906 Congress transferred the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the park.
[216]



[217]==
[218]Nature writer ==
[219]

[220]In John Muir's life, John Muir published six volumes of writings, all describing explorations of natural settings.
[221]Four additional books were published posthumously.
[222]Several books were subsequently published that collected essays and articles from various sources.
[223]Miller writes that what was most important about John Muir's writings was not their quantity, but their "quality".
[224]He notes that they have had a "lasting effect on American culture in helping to create the desire and will to protect and preserve wild and natural environments".
[225]:
[226] 173
[227] 
[228]John Muir first appearance in print was by accident, writes Miller; a person John Muir did not know submitted, without John Muir's permission or awareness, a personal letter to John Muir's friend Jeanne Carr, describing Calypso borealis, a rare flower John Muir had encountered.
[229]The piece was published anonymously, identified as having been written by an "inspired pilgrim".
[230]: 174
[231]  
[232]Throughout John Muir's many years as a nature writer, John Muir frequently rewrote and expanded on earlier writings from John Muir's journals, as well as articles published in magazines.
[233]John Muir often compiled and organized such earlier writings as collections of essays or included them as part of narrative books.

=== Jeanne Carr: friend and mentor =
[235]=
[236]=
[237]

[238]John Muir friendship with Jeanne Carr had a lifelong influence on John Muir's career as a naturalist and writer.
[239]They first met in the fall of 1860, when, at age 22, John Muir entered a number of John Muir's homemade inventions in the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society Fair.
[240]Carr, a fair assistant, was asked by fair officials to review John Muir exhibits to see if they had merit.
[241]She thought they did and "saw in John Muir's entries evidence of genius worthy of special recognition", notes Miller.
[242]:
[243] 33
[244]  
[245]As a result, John Muir received a diploma and a monetary award for John Muir's handmade clocks and thermometer.: 1  During the next three years while a student at the University of Wisconsin, John Muir was befriended by Carr and her husband, Ezra, a professor at the same university.
[246]According to John Muir biographer Bonnie Johanna Gisel, the Carrs recognized John Muir's "pure mind, unsophisticated nature, inherent curiosity, scholarly acumen, and independent thought".
[247]Jeanne Carr, 35 years of age, especially appreciated John Muir's youthful individuality, along with John Muir's acceptance of "religious truths" that were much like her own.
[248]: 2 
John Muir was often invited to the Carrs' home; John Muir shared Jeanne's love of plants.
[249]In 1864, John Muir left Wisconsin to begin exploring the Canadian wilderness and, while there, began corresponding with her about John Muir's activities.
[250]Carr wrote John Muir in return and encouraged John Muir in John Muir's explorations and writings, eventually having an important influence over John Muir's personal goals.
[251]At one point she asked John Muir to read a book she felt would influence John Muir's thinking, Lamartine's The Stonemason of Saint Point.
[252]It was the story of a man whose life she hoped would "metabolize in John Muir , writes Gisel, and "was a projection of the life she envisioned for John Muir .
[253]According to Gisel, the story was about a "poor man with a pure heart", who found in nature "divine lessons and saw all of God's creatures interconnected".
[254]: 3
[255] After John Muir returned to the United States, John Muir spent the next four years exploring Yosemite, while at the same time writing articles for publication.
[256]During those years, John Muir and Carr continued corresponding.
[257]She sent many of her friends to Yosemite to meet John Muir and "to hear John Muir preach the gospel of the mountains", writes Gisel.
[258]The most notable was naturalist and author Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[259]The importance of Carr, who continually gave John Muir reassurance and inspiration, "cannot be overestimated", adds Gisel.
[260]It was "through John Muir's letters to her that John Muir developed a voice and purpose".
[261]She also tried to promote John Muir writings by submitting John Muir's letters to a monthly magazine for publication.
[262]John Muir came to trust Carr as John Muir's "spiritual mother", and they remained friends for 30 years.
[263]: 6  In one letter she wrote to John Muir while John Muir was living in Yosemite, she tried to keep John Muir from despairing as to John Muir's purpose in life.: 43
[264] 
[265]The value of their friendship was first disclosed by a friend of Carr's, clergyman and writer G. Wharton James.
[266]After obtaining copies of their private letters from Carr, and despite pleadings from John Muir to return them, John Muir instead published articles about their friendship, using those letters as a primary source.
[267]In one such article, John Muir's focus was John Muir debt to Carr, stating that she was John Muir's "guiding star" who "led John Muir into the noble paths of life, and then kept John Muir there".

===
[270]Writing becomes John Muir's work ===
John Muir friend, zoologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, writes that John Muir style of writing did not come to John Muir easily, but only with intense effort.
[271]"Daily John Muir rose at 4:30 o'clock, and after a simple cup of coffee labored incessantly.
[272]...
[273]John Muir groans over John Muir's labors, John Muir writes and rewrites and interpolates".
[274]Osborn notes that John Muir preferred using the simplest English language, and therefore admired above all the writings of Carlyle, Emerson and Thoreau.
[275]"John Muir is a very firm believer in Thoreau and starts by reading deeply of this author".: 29
[276]  
[277]John Muir secretary, Marion Randall Parsons, also noted that "composition was always slow and laborious for John Muir  ...
[278]Each sentence, each phrase, each word, underwent John Muir's critical scrutiny, not once but twenty times before John Muir was satisfied to let it stand".
[279]John Muir often told her, "This business of writing books is a long, tiresome, endless job".
[280]:
[281] 33
[282] 
[283]Miller speculates that John Muir recycled John Muir's earlier writings partly due to John Muir's "dislike of the writing process".
[284]He adds that John Muir "did not enjoy the work, finding it difficult and tedious".
[285]John Muir was generally unsatisfied with the finished result, finding prose "a weak instrument for the reality John Muir wished to convey".
[286]: 173
[287]  
[288]However, John Muir was prodded by friends and John Muir's wife to keep writing and as a result of their influence John Muir kept at it, although never satisfied.
[289]John Muir wrote in 1872, "No amount of word-making will ever make a single soul to 'know' these mountains.
[290]One day's exposure to mountains is better than a cartload of books".
[291]:
[292] xviii  In one of John Muir's essays, John Muir gave an example of the deficiencies of writing versus experiencing nature.


== Philosophical beliefs
[293]=
[294]=


=== Of nature and theology ===
John Muir believed that to discover truth, John Muir must turn to what John Muir believed were the most accurate sources.
[295]In John Muir's book, The Story of John Muir Boyhood and Youth (1913), John Muir writes that during John Muir's childhood, John Muir's father made John Muir read the Bible every day.
[296]John Muir eventually memorized three-quarters of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament.
[297]: 20
[298]  
[299]John Muir father read Josephus's War of the Jews to understand the culture of first-century Judea, as it was written by an eyewitness, and illuminated the culture during the period of the New Testament.: 43  But as John Muir became attached to the American natural landscapes John Muir explored, Williams notes that John Muir began to see another "primary source for understanding God: the Book of Nature".
[300]According to Williams, in nature, especially in the wilderness, John Muir was able to study the plants and animals in an environment that John Muir believed "came straight from the hand of God, uncorrupted by civilization and domestication".
[301]: 43  As Tallmadge notes, John Muir belief in this "Book of Nature" compelled John Muir to tell the story of "this creation in words any reader could understand".
[302]As a result, John Muir's writings were to become "prophecy, for [they] sought to change our angle of vision".
[303]: 53
[304] 
[305]Williams notes that John Muir philosophy and world view rotated around John Muir's perceived dichotomy between civilization and nature. From this developed John Muir's core belief that "wild is superior".
[306]: 41
[307]  
[308]John Muir nature writings became a "synthesis of natural theology" with scripture that helped John Muir understand the origins of the natural world.
[309]According to Williams, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Dick suggested that the "best place to discover the true attributes of deity was in Nature".
[310]John Muir came to believe that God was always active in the creation of life and thereby kept the natural order of the world.
[311]: 
[312]41  As a result, John Muir "styled John Muir as a John the Baptist", adds Williams, "whose duty was to immerse in 'mountain baptism' everyone John Muir could".
[313]: 
[314]46
[315]  
[316]Williams concludes that John Muir saw nature as a great teacher, "revealing the mind of God", and this belief became the central theme of John Muir's later journeys and the "subtext" of John Muir's nature writing.
[317]: 50 During John Muir's career as writer and while living in the mountains, John Muir continued to experience the "presence of the divine in nature", writes Holmes.: 5 : 317  John Muir personal letters also conveyed these feelings of ecstasy.
[318]Historian Catherine Albanese stated that in one of John Muir's letters, "John Muir eucharist made Thoreau's feast on wood-chuck and huckleberry seem almost anemic".
[319]John Muir was extremely fond of Thoreau and was probably influenced more by him than even Emerson.
[320]John Muir often referred to John Muir as a "disciple" of Thoreau.
[321]: 100 


=== Of sensory perceptions and light ===
During John Muir's first summer in the Sierra as a shepherd, John Muir wrote field notes that emphasized the role that the senses play in human perceptions of the environment.
[322]According to Williams, John Muir speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes John Muir  "If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us ... we would never doubt that we were in another world ...":
[323] 43  
[324]While doing John Muir's studies of nature, John Muir would try to remember everything John Muir observed as if John Muir's senses were recording the impressions, until John Muir could write them in John Muir's journal.
[325]As a result of John Muir's intense desire to remember facts, John Muir filled John Muir's field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.
[326]:
[327] 45
[328] However, John Muir took John Muir's journal entries further than recording factual observations.
[329]Williams notes that the observations John Muir recorded amounted to a description of "the sublimity of Nature", and what amounted to "an aesthetic and spiritual notebook".
[330]John Muir felt that John Muir's task was more than just recording "phenomena", but also to "illuminate the spiritual implications of those phenomena", writes Williams.
[331]For John Muir  mountain skies, for example, seemed painted with light, and came to "... symbolize divinity".
[332]: 45  John Muir often described John Muir's observations in terms of light.
[333]John Muir biographer Steven Holmes notes that John Muir used words like "glory" and "glorious" to suggest that light was taking on a religious dimension: "It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the notion of glory in John Muir published writings, where no other single image carries more emotional or religious weight",: 178  adding that John Muir's words "exactly parallels its Hebraic origins", in which biblical writings often indicate a divine presence with light, as in the burning bush or pillar of fire, and described as "the glory of God".
[334]: 179 :
[335] 
[336]24 


=== Seeing nature as home ===
John Muir often used the term "home" as a metaphor for both nature and John Muir's general attitude toward the "natural world itself", notes Holmes.
[337]John Muir often used domestic language to describe John Muir's scientific observations, as when John Muir saw nature as providing a home for even the smallest plant life: "the little purple plant, tended by its Maker, closed its petals, crouched low in its crevice of a home, and enjoyed the storm in safety".: 57
[338]  
[339]John Muir also saw nature as John Muir's own home, as when John Muir wrote friends and described the Sierra as "God's mountain mansion".
[340]John Muir considered not only the mountains as home, however, as John Muir also felt a closeness even to the smallest objects: "The very stones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly.
[341]No wonder when we consider that we all have the same Father and Mother".
[342]: 319 In John Muir's later years, John Muir used the metaphor of nature as home in John Muir's writings to promote wilderness preservation.: 1
[343] 
[344]Not surprisingly, John Muir deep-seated feeling about nature as being John Muir's true home led to tension with John Muir's family at John Muir's home in Martinez, California.
[345]John Muir once told a visitor to John Muir's ranch there, "This is a good place to be housed in during stormy weather, ... to write in, and to raise children in, but it is not John Muir home.
[346]Up there", pointing towards the Sierra Nevada, "is John Muir home".
[347]: 74 


=== Native Americans =
[348]=
[349]=
[350]

[351]John Muir expressed mixed attitudes towards Native Americans over John Muir's life, from sympathy to distaste.
[352]John Muir saw nature as ideal when it was free from man's influence, including Native Americans, but John Muir did not recognize that the landscapes John Muir loved had been shaped by Native Americans for millennia.
[353]John Muir earliest encounters, during John Muir's childhood in Wisconsin, were with Winnebago Indians, who begged for food and stole John Muir's favorite horse.
[354]In spite of that, John Muir had expressed sympathy for their "being robbed of their lands and pushed ruthlessly back into narrower and narrower limits by alien races who were cutting off their means of livelihood".
[355]John Muir early encounters with the Paiute in California left John Muir feeling ambivalent after seeing their lifestyle, which John Muir described as "lazy" and "superstitious".
[356]John Muir wrote of the Miwoks in Yosemite as “most ugly, and some of them altogether hideous" and that “they seemed to have no right place in the landscape, and John Muir was glad to see them fading out of sight down the pass.”
[357]Ecofeminist philosopher Carolyn Merchant has criticized John Muir  believing that John Muir wrote disparagingly of the Native Americans John Muir encountered in John Muir's early explorations.
[358]Later, after living with Indians, John Muir praised and grew more respectful of their low impact on the wilderness, compared to the heavy impact by European Americans.
[359]However, in John Muir's journals, John Muir often describes those John Muir encounters as "dirty," "irregular" and "unnatural."John Muir [360]was given the Stickeen (John Muir spelling, coastal tribe) name "Ancoutahan", meaning "adopted chief".
[361]In response to claims about John Muir attitudes about Native Americans, Sierra Club national Board member Chad Hanson wrote, "John Muir wrote repeatedly about the intelligence and dignity of Native Americans, and honored how traditional Indigenous peoples lived in peaceful coexistence with Nature and wild creatures, expressing John Muir's view that Native peoples ‘rank above’ white settlers, who John Muir increasingly described as selfish, base, and lacking honor.
[362]This would become a constant theme in John Muir writings, as John Muir attacked the dominant white culture's destructive and greedy ways, and its anthrosupremacist mindset that placed humans above all else and recognized no intrinsic value in ecosystems or wildlife species beyond whatever profit could be gained by exploiting them."


===
[363]African Americans ===
John Muir spoke and wrote about the equality of all people, "regardless of color, or race", and wrote about the immorality of slavery in John Muir's final book, Travels in Alaska.
[364]During John Muir's time in Alaska John Muir also wrote,...how we were all children of one father
[365]; sketched the characteristics of the different races of mankind, showing that no matter how far apart their countries were, how they differed in color, size, language, etc. and no matter how different and how various the ways in which they got a living, that the white man and all the people of the world were essentially alike, that we all had ten fingers and toes and our bodies were the same, whether white, brown, black or different colors, and speak different languages.
[366]

[367]In John Muir's earlier years, John Muir did make some disparaging remarks about African Americans.
[368]In A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf, John Muir described African Americans as "well trained" but "making a great deal of noise and doing little work.
[369]One energetic white man, working with a will, would easily pick as much cotton as half a dozen Sambos and Sallies."
[370]Describing the sight of two African Americans at a campfire, John Muir wrote, "John Muir could see their ivory gleaming from the great lips, and their smooth cheeks flashing off light as if made of glass.
[371]Seen anywhere but in the South, the glossy pair would have been taken for twin devils, but here it was only a Negro and his wife at their supper."
[372]However, at no point in John Muir personal journey to the Gulf did John Muir support or empathize with the Southern cause, avoiding entreaties from Southern hosts when they prodded John Muir 
[373]

[374]In 2020, in light of the movement to remove Confederate monuments across the country, Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, reflected on John Muir complex and controversial legacy and announced that the club would shift towards investing in racial justice work and determine which of its monuments need to be renamed or removed.
[375]On July 22, 2020, the Sierra Club wrote:John Muir was not immune to the racism peddled by many in the early conservation movement.
[376]John Muir made derogatory comments about Black people and Indigenous peoples that drew on deeply harmful racist stereotypes, though John Muir's views evolved later in John Muir's life.
[377]As the most iconic figure in Sierra Club history, John Muir words and actions carry an especially heavy weight.
[378]They continue to hurt and alienate Indigenous people and people of color who come into contact with the Sierra Club.
[379]
Some of John Muir associates cited by Brune and others, such as Joseph LeConte, David Starr Jordan, and Henry Fairfield Osborn were closely related to the early eugenics movement in the United States.
[380]Some claim John Muir did not espouse such beliefs.
[381]

[382]Aaron Mair, who in 2015 became the first Black president of the Sierra Club board, stated that the contents and framing of John Muir in Brune's post "are a misrepresentation".
[383]Mair went on to state that Brune, "did not consult him or the other two Black board members before pushing ahead on what he called a “revisionist” and “ahistorical” account of John Muir writings, thoughts and life."
[384]Mair, along with two other Sierra Club board members, Chad Hanson and Mary Ann Nelson, wrote a response to Brune's attack on John Muir  writing:...while some of John Muir colleagues promoted White supremacist myths and exclusionary views regarding national parks and forests, John Muir spoke out about the importance of making these areas accessible and encouraging all people to experience them, writing, “Few are altogether deaf to the preaching of pine trees.
[385]Their sermons on the mountains go to our hearts; and if people in general could be got into the woods, even for once, to hear the trees speak for themselves, all difficulties in the way of forest preservation would vanish.”
[386]John Muir came to believe deeply in the equality of all people, writing, “We all flow from one fountain Soul.
[387]All are expressions of one Love.
[388]God does not appear, and flow out, only from narrow chinks and round bored wells here and there in favored races and places.”


===
[389]Hetch Hetchy dam controversy =
[390]=
[391]=
With population growth continuing in San Francisco, political pressure increased to dam the Tuolumne River for use as a water reservoir.
[392]John Muir passionately opposed the damming of Hetch Hetchy Valley because John Muir found Hetch Hetchy as stunning as Yosemite Valley.: 249–62  John Muir  the Sierra Club and Robert Underwood Johnson fought against inundating the valley.
[393]John Muir wrote to President Roosevelt pleading for him to scuttle the project.
[394]Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft, suspended the Interior Department's approval for the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way.
[395]After years of national debate, Taft's successor Woodrow Wilson signed the bill authorizing the dam into law on December 19, 1913.
[396]John Muir felt a great loss from the destruction of the valley, John Muir's last major battle.
[397]John Muir wrote to John Muir's friend Vernon Kellogg, "As to the loss of the Sierra Park Valley [Hetch Hetchy] it's hard to bear.
[398]The destruction of the charming groves and gardens, the finest in all California, goes to John Muir heart.
[399]"
[400]


== Personal life =
[401]=
In 1878, when John Muir was nearing the age of 40, John Muir friends "pressured John Muir to return to society".
[402]Soon after John Muir returned to the Oakland area, John Muir was introduced by Jeanne Carr to Louisa Strentzel, daughter of a prominent physician and horticulturist with a 2,600-acre (11 km2) fruit orchard in Martinez, California, northeast of Oakland.
[403]In 1880, after John Muir returned from a trip to Alaska, John Muir and Strentzel married.
[404]John Muir went into partnership with John Muir's father-in-law John Strentzel, and for ten years directed most of John Muir's energy into managing this large fruit farm.
[405]Although John Muir was a loyal, dedicated husband, and father of two daughters, "John Muir's heart remained wild", writes Marquis.
[406]John Muir wife understood John Muir's needs, and after seeing John Muir's restlessness at the ranch would sometimes "shoo John Muir back up" to the mountains.
[407]John Muir sometimes took John Muir's daughters with John Muir 
[408]The house and part of the ranch are now the John Muir National Historic Site.
[409]In addition, the W.H.C. Folsom House, where John Muir worked as a printer, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
[410]
John Muir became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1903.
[411]


== Death ==
John Muir died, aged 76, at California Hospital in Los Angeles on December 24, 1914, of pneumonia.
[412]John Muir had been in Daggett, California, to see John Muir's daughter, Helen Muir Funk.
[413]John Muir grandson, Ross Hanna, lived until 2014, when he died at age 91.
[414]


== Legacy ==
During John Muir's lifetime John Muir published over 300 articles and 12 books.
[415]John Muir co-founded the Sierra Club, which helped establish a number of national parks after John Muir died.
[416]Today the club has over 2.4 million members.
[417]
John Muir has been called the "patron saint of the American wilderness" and its "archetypal free spirit".
[418]"As a dreamer and activist, John Muir's eloquent words changed the way Americans saw their mountains, forests, seashores, and deserts", said nature writer Gretel Ehrlich.
[419]John Muir not only led the efforts to protect forest areas and have some designated as national parks, but John Muir's writings presented "human culture and wild nature as one of humility and respect for all life".
[420]Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine, which published many of John Muir articles, states that John Muir influenced people's appreciation of nature and national parks, which became a lasting legacy:

The world will look back to the time we live in and remember the voice of one crying in the wilderness and bless the name of John Muir  ...
[421]John Muir sung the glory of nature like another Psalmist, and, as a true artist, was unashamed of John Muir's emotions.
[422]John Muir countrymen owe John Muir gratitude as the pioneer of our system of national parks.
[423]... John Muir writings and enthusiasm were the chief forces that inspired the movement.
[424]All the other torches were lighted from John Muir's 
[425]

[426]John Muir exalted wild nature over human culture and civilization, believing that all life was sacred.
[427]Turner describes John Muir as "a man who in John Muir's singular way rediscovered America. ...
[428]an American pioneer, an American hero".
[429]The primary aim of John Muir nature philosophy, writes Wilkins, was to challenge mankind's "enormous conceit", and in so doing, John Muir moved beyond the Transcendentalism of Emerson to a "biocentric perspective on the world".
[430]John Muir did so by describing the natural world as "a conductor of divinity", and John Muir's writings often made nature synonymous with God.: 265
[431]  
[432]John Muir friend, Henry Fairfield Osborn, observed that as a result of John Muir's religious upbringing, John Muir retained "this belief, which is so strongly expressed in the Old Testament, that all the works of nature are directly the work of God".
[433]In the opinion of Enos Mills, a contemporary who established Rocky Mountain National Park, John Muir writings would "likely to be the most influential force in this century".
[434]Since 1970, the University of the Pacific has housed many of John Muir books and personal papers, including journals, notes, correspondence, among others.
[435]In 2019, the University of the Pacific was given full ownership of the John Muir collection, which had been expanding over the years.
[436]The university has a John Muir Center for Environmental Studies, the Muir Experience, as well as  other programs related to John Muir and John Muir's work.
[437]
