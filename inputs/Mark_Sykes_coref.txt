[1]Colonel Sir Tatton Benvenuto Mark Sykes, 6th Baronet (16 March 1879 – 16 February 1919) was an English traveller, Conservative Party politician, and diplomatic advisor, particularly with regard to the Middle East at the time of the First World War.
[2]

[3]Mark Sykes is associated with the Sykes–Picot Agreement, drawn up while the war was in progress regarding the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire by the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire, and was a key negotiator of the Balfour Declaration.


== Early life ==
Born in Westminster, London, Mark Sykes was the only child of Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet, who, when a 48-year-old wealthy bachelor, married Christina Anne Jessica Cavendish-Bentinck, 30 years Mark Sykes's junior.
[4]Several accounts suggest that Mark Sykes's future mother-in-law essentially trapped Mark Sykes into marrying Christina.
[5]They were reportedly an unhappy couple.
[6]After spending large amounts of money paying off Mark Sykes's wife's debts, Mark Sykes published a notice in the papers disavowing her future debts and legally separating from her.
[7]

[8]Lady Sykes lived in London, and Mark Sykes divided Mark Sykes's time between her home and Mark Sykes's Mark Sykes 34,000 acre (120 km2) East Riding of Yorkshire estates.
[9]Their seat was Sledmere House.
[10]Lady Sykes converted to Roman Catholicism and Mark Sykes was brought into that faith from the age of three.
[11]Sledmere House "lay like a ducal demesne among the Wolds, approached by long straight roads and sheltered by belts of woodland, surrounded by large prosperous farms...ornamented with the heraldic triton of the Sykes family...the mighty four-square residence and the exquisite parish church."
[12]The family farm also had a stud, where Mark Sykes bred Mark Sykes's prized Arabs.
[13]
Mark Sykes was left much to Mark Sykes's own devices and developed an imagination, without the corresponding self-discipline to make Mark Sykes a good scholar.
[14]Most winters Mark Sykes travelled with Mark Sykes's Mark Sykes to the Middle East, especially the Ottoman Empire.
[15]

[16]Mark Sykes was educated at the Jesuit Beaumont College and Jesus College, Cambridge.  Mark Sykes did not finish a degree, unlike Mark Sykes's rival T. E. Lawrence, who graduated from Jesus College, Oxford.
[17]By the age of twenty-five, Mark Sykes had published at least four books; D'Ordel's Pantechnicon (1904), a parody of the magazines of the period (illustrated by Edmund Sandars); D'Ordel's Tactics and Military Training (1904), a parody of the Infantry Drill Book of 1896 (also with Sandars); and two travel books, Dar-ul-Islam ('The Home of Islam', 1904) and Through Five Turkish Provinces (1900).
[18]Mark Sykes also wrote The Caliphs' Last Heritage: A Short History of the Turkish Empire, the first half of which is a brief overview of political geography of the Middle East up to the Ottoman Empire while the second half is an account of Mark Sykes travels in Asia Minor and the Middle East between 1906 and 1913. At Mark Sykes's memorial service an old friend, Aubrey Herbert, diplomat and scholar, would remember Mark Sykes with affection:
[19]"
[20]An effervescent personality; Mark Sykes could turn a gathering into a party, a party into a festival.
[21] Mark Sykes bubbled with ideas, and Mark Sykes swept up Mark Sykes's listeners with Mark Sykes's enthusiasm.
[22] 
[23]In addition Mark Sykes had a remarkable talent for sketching caricatures and for mimicry ...
[24]Mark Sykes had vitality beyond any man I have ever met.
[25] When one had been in Mark Sykes's company one felt almost as if one had been given from the fountain of life."


== The Boer War, travels and Parliament ==
Heir to vast Yorkshire estates and a baronetcy, Mark Sykes was not content to await Mark Sykes's inheritance.
[26]In 1897 Mark Sykes was commissioned into the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the Green Howards.
[27]Mark Sykes was sent abroad with the 5th Battalion of the Green Howards during the Second Boer War for two years, where Mark Sykes was engaged mostly in guard duty, but saw action on several occasions.
[28]Following the war, Mark Sykes was promoted to captain on 28 February 1902, and returned to the United Kingdom on 15 May the same year, when the appointment was confirmed.
[29]Mark Sykes travelled extensively, especially in the Middle East.
[30]

[31]From 1904 to 1905 Mark Sykes was Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, George Wyndham in the last year of Balfour's administration.
[32]Mark Sykes made a friend of the Prime Minister, who went on to serve as Foreign Secretary during the First World War, when Mark Sykes worked closely with Mark Sykes 
[33]Transferred by Balfour, Mark Sykes served as honorary attaché to the British Embassy in Constantinople 1905–06, at which time Mark Sykes began a lifetime's interest in middle eastern affairs of state.
[34]

[35]Mark Sykes was very much a Yorkshire grandee, with Mark Sykes's country seat at Sledmere House, breeding racehorses, sitting on the bench, raising and commanding a militia unit, serving as Honorary Colonel of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, and fulfilling Mark Sykes's social obligations.
[36]Mark Sykes married Edith Gorst, also a Roman Catholic, daughter of the Conservative party manager, Eldon Gorst.
[37]It was a happy union, and they had six children.
[38]Two of those children were Angela Sykes, a sculptor, and Christopher Sykes, author.
[39]Mark Sykes succeeded to the baronetcy and the estates in 1913.
[40]Lady Sykes went on to found a VAD Hospital in Hull during the First World War.
[41]

[42]After two unsuccessful attempts, Mark Sykes was elected to Parliament as a Unionist in 1911, representing Kingston upon Hull Central.
[43]Mark Sykes became close to Lord Hugh Cecil, another MP and was a contemporary of F. E. Smith, later Lord Birkenhead, and Hilaire Belloc.
[44]A JP in the East Riding, Mark Sykes was also elected a member of the County Council.
[45]

[46]Mark Sykes was also a friend of Aubrey Herbert, another Englishman influential in Middle Eastern affairs, and was acquainted with Gertrude Bell, the pro-Arab Foreign Office advisor and Middle Eastern traveller.
[47]Mark Sykes was never as single-minded an advocate of the Arab cause as Bell, and her friends T. E. Lawrence and Sir Percy Cox.
[48]Mark Sykes sympathies and interests later extended to Armenians, Arabs and Jews, as well as Turks.
[49]This is reflected in the Turkish Room Mark Sykes had installed in Sledmere House, using the noted Armenian ceramic artist David Ohannessian as designer.
[50]
The author H. G. Wells noted in the Appendix of his 1913 publication Little Wars, an early publication about the hobby of wargaming with miniature soldiers, that he had exchanged correspondence with Mark Sykes about how his hobby war game might be converted into a proper "Kriegspiel" as played by the British Army and be used as a training aid for young officers.
[51] This Appendix then proceeds to set forth the modifications and additions to the original rules to convert them to this new purpose.
[52]



[53]== Protégé of Kitchener =
[54]=
When the First World War broke out in 1914, Mark Sykes was the commanding officer of the 5th Battalion of the Green Howards.
[55]However Mark Sykes did not lead them into battle, as Mark Sykes's particular talents were needed by the Intelligence department of the War Office working for Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War.
[56] Kitchener placed Mark Sykes on Sir Maurice de Bunsen's Committee advising the Cabinet on Middle Eastern affairs.
[57]
Although Mark Sykes never got to know Kitchener well, they shared a similar outlook, and Mark Sykes had gained a new confidence.
[58] Mark Sykes soon became the dominant person on the committee, and so garnering great influence on British Middle Eastern policy, later becoming a prominent expert.  For the Intelligence Unit Mark Sykes wrote pamphlets promoting Arab independence, fomenting revolt against the Ottoman Empire.
[59] Mark Sykes was introduced to Colonel Oswald Fitzgerald, Kitchener's assistant secretary, who continued to be useful contact after the Field Marshal's death.
[60] 
[61]London still hoped to persuade Turkey to abstain from fighting, or to join the Allies' side in the war against the Central Powers.
It was Mark Sykes intelligence that informed the Foreign Office that Turkey would fight alongside Germany – which Fitzgerald carried by letter to Kitchener.
[62](Turkey became a belligerent in November 1914.)
[63]Mark Sykes only saw Kitchener briefly once in his life at York House, on which occasion Mark Sykes was presented with a list of points for discussion.
[64] 
[65]Mark Sykes advice was clear: "Turkey must cease to be...should be done up to the nines and given money and food....
[66]Then premiums might be offered for camels...then a price for telegraphic insulators...then a price for interruption of Hejaz railway line and a good price for Turkish Mausers and a good price for deserters from the Turkish Army...if possible keep the whole of the Hejaz Railway in a ferment and destroy bridges".
[67]Upon Mark Sykes instigation, but not completely according to Mark Sykes's wishes, the Foreign Office set up the Arab Bureau in Cairo in January 1916.
[68]Mark Sykes designed the flag of the Arab Revolt, a combination of green, red, black and white.
[69] 
[70]Variations on Mark Sykes's design later served as flags of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Sudan, Kuwait, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Palestine, none of which existed as separate nations before the First World War.
[71]With the rise of the Lloyd George ministry in December 1916, Mark Sykes was appointed to the War Cabinet Secretariat, and assigned to the British section of the Supreme War Council at Versailles, France.
[72]



[73]==
[74]Britain's strategic conundrum =
[75]=
Mark Sykes had long agreed with the traditional policy of British Conservatives in propping up the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) as a buffer against Russian expansion into the Mediterranean.
[76] Britain feared that Russia had designs on India, its most important colonial possession.
[77] 
[78]A Russian fleet in the Mediterranean might cut British sea routes to India.  British statesmen such as Palmerston, Disraeli and Salisbury had held this view.
[79]Liberal Party leader, William Ewart Gladstone, was much more critical of the Ottoman government, deploring its misgovernment and periodic slaughter of minorities, especially Christian ones.
[80]A Liberal successor, David Lloyd George, shared a progressively disdainful attitude towards the 'sick man' of Europe.
[81]
Compounding Britain's difficulties, France sought to secure a Greater Syria, where there were significant minorities, that included Palestine.
[82] Another ally, Italy, advanced claims to the Aegean Islands offering protection to Christian minorities in Asia Minor.
[83]Then Russian claims had to be considered, particularly with respect to control of the Straits leading from the Black Sea to the Aegean and protection of the Christian population of Turkish Armenia and the Black Sea coast.
[84]Greece coveted historic Byzantine territories in Asia Minor and Thrace, claims that conflicted with those of Russia and Italy, as well as Turkey.
[85]David Lloyd George, favoured the Greek cause.
[86]Complicating this was the desire of Zionists to have a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
[87]
Mark Sykes set off from London on a journey of six months' duration overland across Europe to Bulgaria.
[88] 
[89]Mark Sykes stopped at Sofia, and thence took ship to the British HQ in the Dardanelles.  From Turkey, travelling to Cairo, Egypt, down the Suez Canal to Aden on the Yemen peninsula.  From the Port of Aden Mark Sykes crossed the Indian Ocean to Simla, India, and then back to Egypt.
[90]Mark Sykes was debriefed by the Arab Bureau at Cairo HQ.
[91]Lloyd, Herbert, and other Egyptian army officers were there.
[92]Cheetham had been replaced by Sir Henry MacMahon as High Commissioner; with the secretariat of Clayton and Storrs still in support.
[93] Mark Sykes amused the High Commissioner with mimicry of Turks and Syrians, drawing caricatures of the General Staff.  But Mark Sykes was also on a fact-finding mission reporting back to the De Bunsen Committee, to which Mark Sykes had been appointed by Kitchener in March 1915.
[94]

[95]In mid-July 1915 the Emir Abdullah finally broke silence after 6 months to reply to the proposals which Sir Ronald Storrs had put to his father the Grand Sharif.
[96]Mark Sykes had left Cairo and travelled through Syria.
[97] 
[98]By 8 December 1915 Mark Sykes returned to England, having also met Lawrence, to gain support for an Arab Revolt.
[99]However T. E. Lawrence called Mark Sykes "the imaginative advocate of unconvincing world movements... a bundle of prejudices, intuitions, half-sciences.
[100]Mark Sykes ideas were of the outside; and Mark Sykes lacked patience to test Mark Sykes's materials before choosing the style of building …
[101]Mark Sykes would sketch out in a few dashes a new world, all out of scale, but vivid as a vision of some sides of the thing we hoped".
[102]Lawrence thought Mark Sykes a good fellow, but a sadly unreliable intellect.
[103]Gertrude Bell and Lawrence were less congenial, and not Mark Sykes's favourite people in the Arab Bureau.
[104]Mark Sykes remained a purist who shunned democratic progress, instead vesting Mark Sykes's energy in an indomitable Arab Spirit.
[105]Mark Sykes was a champion of the Levantine tradition, of a mercantile trading empire, finding the progressive modernisation in the West totally unsuited to the desert kingdoms.
[106]This meant the Alexandretta Plan to roll up Syria, in order to reshape the Middle East on nationalist lines.
[107]On 16 December Mark Sykes met the War Committee of the Cabinet at 11 am.
[108]Although others were present, only Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour, H. H. Asquith and Kitchener spoke.
[109]

[110]It was Mark Sykes special role to hammer out an agreement with Britain's most important ally, France, which was shouldering a disproportionate part of the effort against Germany in the First World War.
[111]Mark Sykes French counterpart was François Georges-Picot and it is generally accepted that Picot got a better deal than expected.
[112](See the Mark Sykes Picot Agreement.)
[113]Mark Sykes came to feel this as well and it bothered Mark Sykes 
[114]



[115]==
[116]The Balfour Declaration ==
[117]

[118]Late morning 16 December 1915 Mark Sykes arrived at Downing street for a meeting to advise Prime Minister Asquith on the situation with the Ottoman Empire.
[119]Mark Sykes made a "statement to the War Council".
[120]Over the last four years Mark Sykes had become the principal British expert on Turkish affairs.
[121]Elected as Conservative MP in Hull in 1911, Mark Sykes's maiden speech in November 1911 was about British foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa.
[122]Mark Sykes brought a map and a three-page document on Mark Sykes's thoughts of middle eastern policy.
[123]In Caliph's Last Heritage Mark Sykes was appalled by the filth and squalor of Aleppo and Damascus.
[124]Whilst Mark Sykes praised the French for inventing the set square for the illiterate Arab, Mark Sykes glossed over the German contribution to building railways that enabled Arabs to travel; Mark Sykes stressed the negative aspects of social squalor.
[125]Mark Sykes underestimated the Turks but W Crooke's review surmised that the facts Mark Sykes collected would be helpful to resolve the Eastern Question.
[126]Across Whitehall, Mark Sykes became known as "the Mad Mullah", even so Mark Sykes was summoned to No. 10, as rumours spread Mark Sykes was to become a Joint Cabinet secretary.
[127]Lloyd George hated the corrupted Ottomans and could not wait to seize imperial power from them; while Balfour at the admiralty, was the only non-bellicose member.
[128] 
[129]Mark Sykes proposed that the issue of Syria be settled as quickly as possible with France.
[130]It was reported on 16 August that Mark Sykes was attending the Stockholm Conference as a paid up member of the Seamen & Firemen's Union, "but it cannot be known Mark Sykes carries their guarantee."
[131]Mark Sykes remained loyal to Maurice Hankey and the Coalition government throughout.
[132] Mark Sykes alerted Hankey, the Cabinet Secretary, to General Maurice's agitation against the Prime Minister and Haig, as well as criticizing the King's part in the war.
[133]Mark Sykes was concerned that rumours were swirling around H. A. Gwynne, The Morning Post's editor, to the effect that Robertson was plotting with Asquith to bring back the old government.
[134]Evidence suggests that Mark Sykes had a hand in promoting the Balfour Declaration to the Cabinet issued on 2 November 1917.
[135]In March Mark Sykes had visited Palestine to meet Chaim Weizmann; Mark Sykes was clearly, with proviso, converted to the cause of Zionism.
[136] It stated that: "His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine..."
[137]
In June 1918, the 14th Division was ordered to remove to Italy from Palestine.
[138] Mark Sykes told Hankey the General Staff had expected Mark Sykes to be in Gaza by Christmas and not Damascus.
[139]Moslem troops, Picot had mentioned were unreliable but Allenby would not be advised by any Political Officer who said the cross-border raids were upsetting the Arabs.
[140]Mark Sykes had begun to change Mark Sykes's views on Zionism in late 1918.
[141]Diplomat and Mark Sykes biographer, Shane Leslie, wrote in 1923:

From being the evangelist of Zionism during the war Mark Sykes had returned to Paris with feelings shocked by the intense bitterness which had been provoked in the Holy Land.
[142]Matters had reached a stage beyond Mark Sykes's conception of what Zionism would be.
[143]Mark Sykes last journey to Palestine had raised many doubts, which were not set at rest by a visit to Rome.
[144]To Cardinal Gasquet Mark Sykes admitted the change of Mark Sykes's views on Zionism, and that Mark Sykes was determined to qualify, guide and, if possible, save the dangerous situation which was rapidly arising.
[145]If death had not been upon Mark Sykes it would not have been too late.
[146]"


== Death ==
Mark Sykes was in Paris in connection with peace negotiations in 1919.
[147]At the conference, a junior diplomat present, Harold Nicolson, wrote in his diary the day after Mark Sykes death: "...It was due to Mark Sykes's endless push and perseverance, to Mark Sykes's enthusiasm and faith, that Arab nationalism and Zionism became two of the most successful of our war causes..."Mark Sykes died in Mark Sykes's room at the Hôtel Le Lotti near the Tuileries Garden on 16 February 1919, aged 39, a victim of the Spanish flu pandemic.
[148] Mark Sykes remains were transported back to Mark Sykes's family home at Sledmere House (in the East Riding of Yorkshire) for burial.
[149]Although Mark Sykes had been a Roman Catholic, Mark Sykes was buried in the churchyard of the local Anglican St. Mary's church in Sledmere.
[150]Nahum Sokolow, a Russian Zionist colleague of Chaim Weizmann in Paris at this time, wrote that Mark Sykes "... fell as a hero at our side."
[151]
Mark Sykes was succeeded by Mark Sykes's son, Sir Richard Sykes, 7th Baronet (1905–1978).  Another son, Christopher Sykes (1907–1986), was a distinguished author and official biographer of Evelyn Waugh.
[152] Mark Sykes great-grandchildren include the New York-based fashion writer and novelist Plum Sykes and her twin sister, Lucy Sykes (Mrs. Euan Rellie), and their brother, writer Thomas (Tom) Sykes.
[153]
Sledmere House is still in the possession of the family, with Mark Sykes eldest grandson Sir Tatton Sykes, 8th Baronet, being the current occupant.  Another brother, Christopher Sykes, or his son, will eventually inherit the baronetcy.
[154]



[155]== Honours ==
Mark Sykes received during Mark Sykes's service no British honours but Mark Sykes was made a Commander of the Order of St Stanislas by Tsarist Russia and held the Order of the Star of Romania.
[156]



[157]== Exhumation for biological research ==
In 2007, 88 years after Mark Sykes died, all the living descendants gave their permission to exhume Mark Sykes's body for scientific investigation headed by virologist John Oxford.
[158]Mark Sykes remains were exhumed in mid-September 2008.
[159]Mark Sykes remains were of interest because Mark Sykes had been buried in a lead-lined coffin, and this was thought likely to have preserved Spanish flu viral particles intact.
[160]Any samples taken are to be used for research in the quest to develop defences against future influenza pandemics.
[161]The Spanish flu virus itself became a human infection by a mutation of an avian virus called H1N1.
[162]
There are only five other extant samples of the Spanish flu virus.
[163] Professor Oxford's team was expecting to find a well-preserved cadaver.
[164]However, the coffin was found to be split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was found to be badly decomposed.
[165]Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split in the coffin, with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process.
[166]Soon afterwards, the open grave was sealed again by refilling it with earth.
[167]



[168]== Legacy ==
Mark Sykes is a major feature in Balfour to Blair, a documentary about the history of British involvement in the Middle East.
[169]The Sledmere Cross takes the form of an Eleanor Cross and is a true folly that Mark Sykes converted into a war memorial in 1919.
[170]Mark Sykes added a series of brass portraits in commemoration of Mark Sykes's friends and the local men who fell in the war.
[171]Mark Sykes also added a brass portrait Mark Sykes in crusader armour with the inscription Laetare Jerusalem (Rejoice, Jerusalem).
[172]

Mark Sykes also designed the Wagoners' Memorial to the men of the Wagoners Special Reserve, a Territorial Army unit that Mark Sykes raised in 1912, composed of farm labourers and tenant farmers from across the Yorkshire Wolds intended for war service as drivers of horse-drawn wagons.
