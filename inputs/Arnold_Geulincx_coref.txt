[1]Arnold Geulincx (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɣøːlɪŋks]; 31 January 1624 – November 1669), also known by his pseudonym Philaretus, was a Flemish philosopher, metaphysician, and logician.
[2]Arnold Geulincx was one of the followers of René Descartes who tried to work out more detailed versions of a generally Cartesian philosophy.
[3]Samuel Beckett cited Arnold Geulincx as a key influence and interlocutor because of Arnold Geulincx emphasis on the powerlessness and ignorance of the human condition.

[5]== Life ==
Arnold Geulincx was born in Antwerp.
[6]Arnold Geulincx studied philosophy and theology at the University of Leuven and was made professor of philosophy there in 1646.
[7]Arnold Geulincx lost Arnold Geulincx's post in 1658, possibly for religious reasons, or (as has been suggested) a combination of unpopular views and Arnold Geulincx's marriage in that year.
[8]In September 1658, Arnold Geulincx became a medical doctor.
[9]Arnold Geulincx then moved north to the University of Leiden and converted to Calvinism.
[10]Initially Arnold Geulincx gave private lessons in philosophy.
[11]Arnold Geulincx was appointed reader in logic there in 1662 and professor by special appointment in 1665.
[12]Until 1662, Arnold Geulincx lived in poverty.
[13]Arnold Geulincx died in Leiden in November 1669, leaving most of Arnold Geulincx's works, all written in Latin, to be published after Arnold Geulincx's death.
[14]They were edited by Cornelis Bontekoe.
[15]


== Reputation ==
Despite Arnold Geulincx thesis that God cannot act without an instrumentality of variety, Arnold Geulincx was strongly attacked in the early eighteenth century, for example, by Ruardus Andala and Carolus Tuinman, as a Spinozist.
[16]This criticism had originated from Christian Thomasius in 1710.
[17]The attack from Andala was on behalf of the "true" Cartesians, classing Arnold Geulincx as pernicious, with Burchardus de Volder, Jean LeClerc, Frederik van Leenhof, Pontiaan van Hattem and Willem Deurhoff.
[18]Arnold Geulincx was also attacked by the Pietist Joachim Lange, as part of a campaign against Christian Wolff; and regarded with Pierre Bayle as insidiously anti-Christian by Johann Franz Buddeus.
[19]


== Philosophy ==

[20]Arnold Geulincx summarized Arnold Geulincx's philosophy in the phrase "ita est, ergo ita sit" ("it exists, therefore it is so").
[21]Arnold Geulincx believed in a "pre-established harmony" as a solution to the mind–body problem, dying 25 years before Leibniz's better-remembered formulation of the idea.
[22]In Leibniz's philosophy, the doctrine of pre-established harmony was linked with optimism, the notion of this world as the "best of all possible worlds".
[23]But Arnold Geulincx made no such linkage.
[24]

[25]The occasionalism of Arnold Geulincx is ethical rather than cosmological in its inception.
[26]The first tract of Arnold Geulincx's Ethics is a study of what in Arnold Geulincx's terms are the cardinal virtues.
[27]Virtue according to Arnold Geulincx is the love of God and of Reason (III, 16–17; 29).
[28]The cardinal virtues are the properties of virtue which immediately flow from its very essence and have nothing to do with externals: diligence, obedience, justice, humility (III, 17).
[29]Humility divides Arnold Geulincx's view of the world into two parts: one, the understanding of our relation to the world; and the other, the concept of our relation to God.
[30]Humility consists in the knowledge of self and the forsaking of self.
[31]Arnold Geulincx find in Arnold Geulincx nothing that is Arnold Geulincx own but to know and to will.
[32]Arnold Geulincx therefore must be conscious of all that Arnold Geulincx do, and that of which Arnold Geulincx am not conscious is not the product of Arnold Geulincx own causality.
[33]Hence the universal principle of causality –  quod nescis quo modo fiat, non facis –  if you do not know how a thing is done, then you do not do it.
[34]Arnold Geulincx also states a form of this principle in Arnold Geulincx's Metaphysica vera.
[35]Since, then, the movements of Arnold Geulincx body take place without Arnold Geulincx knowing how the nervous impulse passes to the muscles and there causes them to contract, Arnold Geulincx do not cause Arnold Geulincx own bodily actions.
[36]"Arnold Geulincx am therefore a mere spectator of this machine.
[37]In it Arnold Geulincx form naught and renew naught, Arnold Geulincx neither make anything here nor destroy it.
[38]Everything is the work of someone else" (III, 33).
[39]This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things.
[40]The second part of Arnold Geulincx philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause.
[41]Its guiding principle is: Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing (III, 222).
[42]This leads to a mysticism and asceticism which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the obligation of caring for the body and propagating the species.
[43]

== Influence ==
Arnold Geulincx is cited by Samuel Beckett, whose character Murphy remembers the "beautiful Belgo-Latin of Arnold Geulincx  and in particular the gloomy nostrum (frequently repeated by Beckett to inquisitive critics) Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis (roughly: "Where you are worth nothing, there you should want nothing").
[47]In the novel Molloy (1950), Beckett's eponymous character describes himself as "I who had loved the image of Arnold Geulincx .
[48]Arnold Geulincx is also mentioned in Beckett's short story "The End".
[49]
A citation of Arnold Geulincx method of despectus sui appears in the "Third Essay" of Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals.
[50]
A quotation from Arnold Geulincx's Ethics (In hoc mundo me extra me nihil agere posse, roughly "In this world I can do nothing outside myself") is used as the epigraph to, and in a sense the title of, A.G. Mojtabai's novel Mundome (1974).
