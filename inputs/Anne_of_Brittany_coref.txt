[1]Anne of Brittany (Breton: Anna; 25/26 January 1477 – 9 January 1514) was reigning Duchess of Brittany from 1488 until Anne of Brittany's death, and Queen of France4 from 1491 to 1498 and from 1499 to Anne of Brittany's death.
[2]Anne of Brittany was the only woman to have been queen consort of France twice.
[3]During the Italian Wars, Anne of Brittany also became Queen of Naples, from 1501 to 1504, and Duchess of Milan, in 1499–1500 and from 1500 to 1512.
[4]

[5]Anne of Brittany was raised in Nantes during a series of conflicts which the King of France sought to assert his suzerainty over Brittany.
[6]Anne of Brittany father, Francis II, Duke of Brittany, was the last male of the House of Montfort.
[7]Upon his death in 1488, Anne of Brittany became duchess regnant of Brittany, countess of Nantes, Montfort, and Richmond, and viscountess of Limoges.
[8]Anne of Brittany was only 11 at that time, but Anne of Brittany was already a coveted heiress because of Brittany's strategic position.
[9]The next year, Anne of Brittany married Maximilian I of Austria by proxy, but Charles VIII of France saw this as a threat since his realm was located between Brittany and Austria.
[10]He started a military campaign which eventually forced Anne of Brittany to renounce Anne of Brittany's marriage.
[11]

[12]Anne of Brittany eventually married Charles VIII in 1491.
[13]None of their children survived early childhood, and when the king died in 1498, the throne went to his cousin, Louis XII.
[14]Following an agreement made to secure the annexation of Brittany, Anne of Brittany had to marry the new king.
[15]Louis XII was deeply in love with Anne of Brittany and Anne of Brittany had many opportunities to reassert the independence of Anne of Brittany's duchy.
[16]They had two daughters, although neither could succeed to the French throne due to the Salic Law, the elder was proclaimed the heiress of Brittany.
[17]Anne of Brittany managed to have Anne of Brittany's elder daughter engaged to Charles of Austria, grandchild of Maximilian I, but after Anne of Brittany death in 1514, Anne of Brittany's daughter married her cousin Francis I of France.
[18]This marriage later led to the formal union between France and Brittany.
[19]
Anne of Brittany was highly regarded in Brittany as a conscientious ruler who defended the duchy against France.
[20]In the Romantic period, Anne of Brittany became a figure of Breton patriotism and Anne of Brittany was honoured with many memorials and statues.
[21]Anne of Brittany artistic legacy is important in the Loire Valley, where Anne of Brittany spent most of Anne of Brittany's life.
[22]Anne of Brittany was notably responsible, with Anne of Brittany's husbands, for architectural projects in the châteaux of Blois and Amboise.

[27]=


=== Early years and education ===
Anne of Brittany was born on 25 or 26 January 1477 in the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in the city of Nantes in what is now the Loire-Atlantique département of France, as the eldest child of Duke Francis II of Brittany and his second wife Margaret of Foix, Infanta of Navarre.
[28]Four years later (before 10 May 1481), Anne of Brittany's parents had a second daughter, Isabelle.
[29]Anne of Brittany mother died when Anne of Brittany was little, while Anne of Brittany's father died when Anne of Brittany was eleven years old.
[30]It is likely that Anne of Brittany learned to read and write in French, and perhaps a little Latin.
[31]Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, it was unlikely that Anne of Brittany learned Greek or Hebrew and never spoke or understood the Breton language.
[32]Anne of Brittany was raised by a governess, Françoise de Dinan, Lady of Chateaubriant and by marriage Countess of Laval.
[33]In addition, Anne of Brittany had several tutors, including Anne of Brittany's butler and court poet, Jean Meschinot, who is thought to have taught Anne of Brittany's dancing, singing and music.
[34]


=== Heiress of Brittany ===
In this period, the law of succession was unclear, but prior to the Breton War of Succession mainly operated according to semi-Salic Law; i.e., noble women could inherit, but only if the male line had died out.
[35]The Treaty of Guérande in 1365, however, stated that in the absence of a male heir from the House of Montfort, the heirs of Joanna of Penthièvre would succeed.
[36]By the time Anne of Brittany was born, Anne of Brittany's father was the only male from the Breton House of Montfort-Brittany, and the Blois-Penthièvre heir was a female, Nicole of Blois, who in 1480 sold her rights over Brittany to King Louis XI of France for the amount of 50,000 écus.
[37]
The lack of a male heir gave rise to the threat of a dynastic crisis in the Duchy, or to its passing directly into the royal domain.
[38]To avoid this, Francis II had Anne of Brittany officially recognised as his heiress by the Estates of Brittany on 10 February 1486; however, the question of Anne of Brittany's marriage remained a diplomatic issue.
[39]

[44]=
Being the first eldest surviving child and heiress of the Duchy of Brittany, Anne of Brittany was, above all, the instrument of paternal politics.
[45]Francis II indeed promised Anne of Brittany to various French or foreign princes in order to obtain military and financial aid, and to strengthen his position against the King of France.
[46]The prospect for these princes to add the duchy to their domain thus allowed the Duke of Brittany to initiate several marriage negotiations and to forge various secret alliances which accompanied these matrimonial projects.
[47]Anne of Brittany became the stake of these rival ambitions, and Anne of Brittany's father, reassured by the signing of these alliances, could afford to refuse various marriage projects and contracts.
[48]These political calculations thus led to Anne of Brittany engagement with different European princes
[49]:
In 1480 Anne of Brittany was officially promised in marriage to Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Edward IV of England; however, soon after the death of Edward IV in 1483, the boy disappeared, presumed to have been killed - possibly on the orders of his regent, Richard III.
[50]
Henry Tudor, the future King Henry VII of England, last male representative of the Lancaster branch, then in exile in Brittany showed interest in being a suitor for Anne of Brittany hand, but this marriage did not interest Anne of Brittany's father.
[51]
Maximilian, King of the Romans and Archduke of Austria, widower of Mary of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Charles the Bold.
Alain I of Albret, son of Catherine of Rohan and Jean I of Albret.
[52]Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of Duke John V of Brittany, and thus a possible heir.
[53]Although he was an ally of Duke Francis II, Anne of Brittany refused to marry him because Anne of Brittany found him repulsive.
[54]Before the papal court, convened by Marshal Rieux, a proponent of Albret's suit, to give the couple a dispensation to marry, Anne of Brittany declared that Anne of Brittany had only entertained his offer of marriage due to "l'obéissance, crainte & révérence" [the obedience, fear, and reverence] due to Anne of Brittany's father, and that Anne of Brittany Anne of Brittany did not want it.
[55]

[56]Louis, Duke of Orléans, cousin of King Charles VIII and in turn future King, was another aspirant for Anne of Brittany's hand, despite being already married to the King's sister Joan.
John IV of Chalon-Arlay, Prince of Orange.
[57]A grandson of Richard, Count of Étampes, and nephew of Francis II
[58], he was in line to the throne after Anne of Brittany and Isabelle.
[59]
Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham.
[60]In 1488 Henry VII had suggested a marriage between Buckingham and Anne of Brittany  but in December 1489 the executors of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, paid the King £4000 for Buckingham's marriage to Percy's eldest daughter Eleanor.
[61]
Viscount John II of Rohan, also in line to the Breton Ducal throne, offered with the support of Marshal Jean IV de Rieux a double marriage of his sons François and Jean with Anne of Brittany and Anne of Brittany's sister Isabelle, but Francis II opposed this plan.
[62]

In 1488, Francis II was defeated at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier, ending the Mad War (la Guerre Folle) between Brittany and France.
[68]In the Treaty of Sablé (19 August 1488), which concluded the peace settlement, the Duke was forced to accept clauses stipulating that his daughters were not to marry without the approval of the King of France.
[69]

[70]With the death of Francis II soon afterwards (9 September 1488) as a result of a fall from his horse, Brittany was plunged into a fresh crisis, leading to the final Franco-Breton war.
[71]On his deathbed, the Duke made Anne of Brittany promise never to consent to the subjugation of the Duchy to the Kingdom of France.
[72]Before he died, Francis II appointed the Marshal of Rieux guardian of Anne of Brittany 
[73]
After fleeing Nantes following the division of Anne of Brittany's advisors over the issue of Anne of Brittany's marriage, Anne of Brittany was crowned Duchess of Brittany in Rennes on 10 February 1489.
[74]At the age of thirteen, on 19 December 1490, Anne of Brittany was married by proxy to Maximilian I of Austria at Rennes Cathedral.
[75]This conferred upon Anne of Brittany's the title Queen of the Romans.
[76]The French regarded it as a serious provocation—it not only violated the Treaty of Sablé (the King of France not having consented to the marriage), but also reintroduced an enemy of the French as ruler of Brittany, which they had wanted to avoid during the 14th and 15th centuries.
[77]The marriage also proved ill-timed: the Habsburgs were too busy in Hungary to pay any serious attention to Brittany, and the Castilians were busy fighting in Granada.
[78]Although both Castile and England sent small numbers of troops to supplement the Ducal army, neither wished for open warfare with France.
[79]The spring of 1491 brought new successes by the French general La Trémoille (the previous victor of the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier), and King Charles VIII of France came to lay siege to Rennes, where Anne of Brittany stayed, to force Anne of Brittany's to desist from Anne of Brittany's Habsburg marriage.
[80]Aided by troops from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and Aragon and Castile, Rennes lasted through two months of Charles's siege before falling.
[81]During this time, Anne of Brittany sister Isabelle died.
[82]

[83]Charles VIII entered the city on 15 November, and both parties signed the Treaty of Rennes, ending the fourth military campaign of the French over Brittany.
[84]After refusing all proposed marriages with French princes, Anne of Brittany became engaged to the King on 17 November 1491, in the vault of the Jacobins in Rennes.
[85]Then, escorted by Anne of Brittany's army (ostensibly to show that Anne of Brittany had willingly consented to the marriage), Anne of Brittany went to Langeais to be married.
[86]Austria made diplomatic protests (especially before the Holy See), claiming that the marriage was illegal because Anne of Brittany was unwilling, that Anne of Brittany was already legally married to Maximilian, and that Charles VIII was legally betrothed to Margaret of Austria, Maximilian's daughter.
[87]

[88]The official marriage between Anne of Brittany and King Charles VIII of France was celebrated in the Great Hall of the Château de Langeais on 6 December 1491 at dawn.
[89]The ceremony was concluded discreetly and urgently because it was technically illegal until Pope Innocent VIII, in exchange for substantial concessions, validated the union on 15 February 1492, by granting the annulment of the marriage by proxy with Maximilian, and also giving a dispensation for the marriage with Charles VIII, needed because the King and Anne of Brittany were related in the forbidden fourth degree of consanguinity.
[90]The marriage contract provided that the spouse who outlived the other would retain possession of Brittany; however, it also stipulated that if Charles VIII died without male heirs, Anne of Brittany would marry his successor, thus ensuring the French kings a second chance to annex Brittany permanently.
[91]



[92]===
[93]Queen of France ===
By the marriage of 1491, Anne of Brittany became Queen consort of France.
[94]Anne of Brittany marriage contract stated that it was concluded to ensure peace between the Duchy of Brittany and the Kingdom of France.
[95]Anne of Brittany made Charles VIII Anne of Brittany's perpetual representative.
[96]On 8 February 1492, Anne of Brittany was crowned Queen of France at St. Denis Basilica.
[97]Anne of Brittany was the first Queen crowned there and consecrated, "anointed in the head and chest" by André d'Espinay, Archbishop of Bordeaux.
[98]Anne of Brittany husband forbade Anne of Brittany's to use the title of Duchess of Brittany, which became a bone of contention between the two.
[99]Gabriel Miron became the Chancellor of Anne of Brittany and Anne of Brittany's first doctor; he signed the marriage contract of Anne of Brittany with King Louis XII on 1 January 1499.Anne of Brittany [100]marriage began badly: Anne of Brittany brought two beds with Anne of Brittany's when Anne of Brittany came to marry Charles, and the King and Anne of Brittany often lived apart; despite this, Anne of Brittany was pregnant for most of Anne of Brittany's married life (with a child every fourteen months on average).
[101]When Anne of Brittany's husband fought in the wars in Italy, the regency powers were exercised by his sister Anne of Beaujeu, who had held this position between 1483 and 1491.
[102]Anne of Brittany had a limited role in France and Brittany and sometimes had to accept being separated from Anne of Brittany's children in infancy.
[103]Anne of Brittany lived primarily in the royal castles of Amboise, Loches and Plessis or in the towns of Lyon, Grenoble or Moulins (when the king was in Italy).
[104]At Amboise, when Charles VIII had work, Anne of Brittany mainly resided in the nearby Clos Lucé, the future home of Leonardo da Vinci.
[105]Anne of Brittany built Anne of Brittany's chapel.
[106]

[107]Anne of Brittany became Queen Consort of Naples and Jerusalem during the conquest of Naples by Charles VIII.


=== Anne of Brittany and remarriage ===
When Charles VIII died as the result of an accident on 4 April 1498, Anne of Brittany was 21 years old and without surviving children.
[108]Anne of Brittany then personally took charge of the administration of the Duchy of Brittany.
[109]Anne of Brittany restored the faithful Philippe de Montauban to the chancellery of Brittany, named Jean de Châlon, Prince of Orange, as Hereditary Lieutenant General of Brittany, appointed Anne of Brittany's squire Gilles of Texue as responsible of the Château de Brest, convened the Estates of Brittany, and ordered production of a gold coin bearing Anne of Brittany's name.
[110]Around Anne of Brittany's  there was a famous circle of court poets, among them the Italian humanist Publio Fausto Andrelini from Forlì (who spread the New Learning in France), historian Jean Lemaire de Belges and poet Jean Marot.
[111]Anne of Brittany also took into Anne of Brittany's service the most famous musicians of Anne of Brittany's time: Johannes Ockeghem, Antoine de Févin, Loyset Compère and Jean Mouton.
[112]Anne of Brittany was undoubtedly the first Queen of France to appear as a patron sought after by artists and writers of Anne of Brittany's time.
[113]Three days after Anne of Brittany's husband's death, the terms of Anne of Brittany's marriage contract came into force; however, the new King, Louis XII, was already married to Joan, daughter of Louis XI and sister to Charles VIII.
[114]On 19 August 1498, at Étampes, Anne of Brittany agreed to marry Louis XII if he obtained an annulment from Joan within a year.
[115]Days later, the process for the annulment of the marriage between Louis XII and Joan of France began.
[116]In the interim, Anne of Brittany returned to Brittany in October 1498.
[117]


[118]If Anne of Brittany was gambling that the annulment would be denied, Anne of Brittany lost: Louis's first marriage was dissolved by Pope Alexander VI before the end of the year.
[119]Anne of Brittany third marriage contract, signed the day of Anne of Brittany's marriage (Nantes, 7 January 1499), was concluded under conditions radically different from those of the second.
[120]Anne of Brittany was no longer a child, but a Dowager Queen, and determined to ensure the recognition of Anne of Brittany's rights as sovereign Duchess from that point forward.
[121]Although Anne of Brittany's new husband exercised the ruler's powers in Brittany, he formally recognized Anne of Brittany's right to the title "Duchess of Brittany" and issued decisions in Anne of Brittany's name.
[122]The contract also stipulated that, since Anne of Brittany personally retained rights to the duchy, the couple's second child, son or daughter, would be Anne of Brittany own heir, thus keeping the duchy separate from the throne of France.
[123]This clause would not be respected.
[124]Anne of Brittany second coronation ceremony as Louis XII's consort took place on 18 November 1504, again at St. Denis Basilica.
[125]Anne of Brittany lived mainly at the Château de Blois, where the presence of Anne of Brittany was visible everywhere.
[126]Anne of Brittany built the tomb of Anne of Brittany's parents at Nantes Cathedral (where Anne of Brittany's heart would also return under the terms of Anne of Brittany's last will) with the symbols of the four virtues: Courage, Temperance, Justice and Prudence, that Anne of Brittany always tried to wear.
[127]All Italian arts were appreciated by Anne of Brittany 
[128]During an illness of Louis XII Anne of Brittany made a tour of Brittany (not the Tro Breizh, contrary to what is often said).
[129]

[130]As Duchess, Anne of Brittany fiercely defended the independence of Anne of Brittany's Duchy.
[131]Anne of Brittany arranged the marriage of Anne of Brittany's daughter, Claude, heiress of the Duchy, to Charles of Austria.
[132]This match would reinforce the Franco-Spanish alliance and ensure French success in the Italian Wars.
[133]The marriage contract was signed on 10 August 1501 in Lyon by François de Busleyden, Archbishop of Besançon, William de Croÿ, Nicolas de Rutter and Pierre Lesseman, all ambassadors of Duke Philip of Burgundy, Charles' father.
[134]Louis XII assented to this plan publicly, but in private worked to match Claude with the heir to the French throne, Francis of Angoulême.
[135]Every time Louis' precarious health threatened his death, steps were taken to cement this match between Claude and Francis.
[136]Anne of Brittany  determined to maintain Breton independence, refused to sanction the marriage until Anne of Brittany's death, pushing instead for Claude to marry Charles, or for Anne of Brittany's other daughter, Renée, to inherit the Duchy.
[137]When Louis XII definitively settled their daughters' dispositions counter to Anne of Brittany's wishes, Anne of Brittany left his side to tour the Duchy, visiting many places Anne of Brittany had never been able to see as a child.
[138]Officially, it was a pilgrimage to the Breton shrines in thanks for one of Louis' recent recoveries, but in reality it was a political journey: an act of independence that sought to assert Anne of Brittany's sovereignty within the marriage.
[139]Letters imply how much Louis took Anne of Brittany's absence to heart: according to a July letter from Louise of Savoy to Michelle de Saubonne, Louis "could not be more anxious" for Anne of Brittany return and "is as wretched as can be without Anne of Brittany's "
[140]By September, he is reported as asking about Anne of Brittany's return at least six times a day.
[141]From June to September 1505, Anne of Brittany made triumphal entries into the cities of the Duchy, where Anne of Brittany's vassals received Anne of Brittany's sumptuously.
[142]In addition, Anne of Brittany ensured the proper collection of taxes.
[143]


== Death ==
Exhausted by many pregnancies and miscarriages, Anne of Brittany died of a kidney-stone attack in the Château de Blois at 6 a.m. on 9 January 1514, after having dictated in Anne of Brittany's will the customary partition of Anne of Brittany's body (dilaceratio corporis, "division of the body" in heart, entrails and bones) with multiple burials, a privilege of the Capetian dynasty, which allowed for multiple ceremonies (funerals of the body - the most important - and heart) and places (the burial of the body and heart).
[144]Anne of Brittany will also conferred the succession of Brittany upon Anne of Brittany's second daughter, Renée.
[145]Anne of Brittany husband ignored this, confirmed Claude as Duchess, put her under the guardianship of Anne of Brittany political rival, Louise of Savoy, and married her to Francis, Louise's son, in the year following Anne of Brittany death.
[146]When Francis became king in 1515, the Duchy of Brittany was once again the property of the queen consort of France.
[147]

[148]Anne of Brittany was buried in the necropolis of Saint Denis.
[149]Anne of Brittany funeral was exceptionally long, lasting 40 days, and it inspired all future French royal funerals until the 18th century.
[150]On this occasion, the Herald of arms of Brittany Pierre Choqué pronounced for the first time the traditional lament: Anne of Brittany est morte!, Anne of Brittany est morte!, Anne of Brittany est morte!
[151](Anne of Brittany is dead!, Anne of Brittany is dead!, Anne of Brittany is dead!).
[152]Choqué, in his record of Anne of Brittany funeral commissioned by Louis XII, Récit des Funérailles d'Anne de Bretagne, recorded that two Masses were read, the first by the Cordeliers (i.e., Franciscans) and the second by the Jacobins (i.e., Dominicans).
[153]Two requiems were also sung, possibly those that survive by Johannes Prioris and Antoine de Févin.
[154]Separate mourning motets by other members of the two royal choirs also survive: Quis dabit oculis by Costanzo Festa and Fiere attropos by Pierre Moulu.
[155]


[156]According to Anne of Brittany's will, Anne of Brittany heart was placed in a raised enamel gold reliquary, then transported to Nantes to be deposited in Anne of Brittany's parents' tomb in the chapel of the Carmelite friars.
[157]This was done on 19 March 1514, but it was later transferred to the Saint-Pierre Cathedral.
[158]Anne of Brittany reliquary is a bivalvular box oval articulated by a hinge, made of a sheet of gold pushed back and guillochéd, broadside of a gold cordelière and topped by a crown of lily and clover.
[159]It is inscribed on the obverse as follows:

En ce petit vaisseau  
De fin or pur et munde  
Repose ung plus grand cueur 
Que Anne of Brittany eut au mundeAnne fut le nom delle
En France deux fois royne
Duchesse des Bretons
Royale et Souveraine.
[160]It was made by anonymous goldsmiths of the court of Blois, and has been attributed to Geoffroy Jacquet and Pierre Mangot working to the designs of Jean Perréal.
[161]In 1792, by order of the National Convention, the reliquary was disinterred and emptied as part of the collection of precious metals belonging to churches.
[162]It was sent to Paris to be melted down, but was kept instead in the National Library.
[163]It was returned to Nantes in 1819 and kept in various museums; it has been in the Dobrée Museum since 1896.
[164]This relic was stolen 13 April 2018 from the Thomas-Dobree museum in Nantes, France.
[165]It was recovered undamaged later that month.
[166]

[167]The double mausoleum Louis XII and Anne of Brittany  carved in Carrara marble, was unveiled at Saint Denis Basilica in 1531.
[168]The baldachin was in arcades, and in the base of the sarcophagus were depicted the victories of Louis XII (Battle of Agnadello, the triumphal entry into Milan), statues of the Twelve Apostles and the four Cardinal virtues, the work of the Juste brothers, Italian sculptors who received the order in 1515.
[169]The transi (whose realism was so shocking that it included an open abdomen stitched after the extraction of the entrails) and orans before a Prie-dieu crowning the platform are attributed to Guillaume Regnault.
[170]The tomb was desecrated during the Revolution on 18 October 1793 and the bodies were thrown into a mass grave.
[171]Alexandre Lenoir saved much of the monument, which was preserved in the Museum of French Monuments in 1795 before being returned to the Royal Basilica under the Second Bourbon Restoration.
[172]


== Personal characteristics ==

[173]Anne of Brittany was a highly intelligent woman who spent much of Anne of Brittany's time on the administration of Brittany.
[174]Anne of Brittany was described as shrewd, proud and haughty in manner.
[175]Anne of Brittany made the safeguarding of Breton autonomy, and the preservation of the Duchy outside the French crown, Anne of Brittany's life's work, although that goal would prove to have failed shortly after Anne of Brittany's death.
[176]

[177]Anne of Brittany was also a patron of the arts and enjoyed music.
[178]A prolific collector of tapestries, it is very likely that the unicorn tapestries now on view at The Cloisters museum in New York City were commissioned by Anne of Brittany's in celebration of Anne of Brittany's wedding to Louis XII.
[179]Of Anne of Brittany's four surviving illuminated manuscript books of hours the most famous is the Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany 
[180] Anne of Brittany also patronized printed books and their authors.
[181]

[182]Anne of Brittany was a devoted mother, spending as much time as possible with Anne of Brittany's children.
[183]Anne of Brittany commissioned a book of prayers for Anne of Brittany's son, Charles-Orland, to use in teaching him how to pray, and as guidance for his role as future King of France.
[184]Unfortunately, Charles-Orland died in 1495, and no other son lived more than a few weeks.
[185]Anne of Brittany also commissioned a primer, yet extant, for Anne of Brittany's then 8-year-old daughter Claude.
[186]The prevalence of Anne of Brittany own coat of arms in the illumination, rather than Louis's, marks this book as a mechanism of transmission of values inter-generationally from Anne of Brittany to daughter, and from queen to queen.
[187]Claude, in turn, commissioned another such book for her younger sister, Renée, whom she raised after Anne of Brittany death.
[188]The contents of these books produced specifically for children—Latin, Biblical scenes, models of proper female behavior—give insight into the priorities of the Princesses' childhood education.
[189]According to the memoirs of Brantôme, Anne of Brittany greatly expanded Anne of Brittany's household and retinue at court, especially in respect to young girls, forming a kind of finishing school, and in having a company of 100 Breton gentlemen at court.
[190]These innovations influenced later French courts.
[191]

[192]At Anne of Brittany's marriage to Charles VIII at age 14, Anne of Brittany was described as a young and rosy-cheeked girl.
[193]By the time of Anne of Brittany's marriage to Louis, aged 22, after seven pregnancies with no surviving children, Anne of Brittany was described as pale-faced and wan.
[194]By the end of Anne of Brittany's life, at 36, Anne of Brittany had been pregnant at least 11 times, from which only two children survived to adulthood.
[195]

[196]Anne of Brittany was trained from a young age to hide Anne of Brittany's limp, caused by a difference in the length of Anne of Brittany's legs, linked to a congenital displacement of Anne of Brittany's hips.
[197]Anne of Brittany wore special heeled shoes to aid in smoothing Anne of Brittany's gait.
[198]Anne of Brittany passed this limp on to Anne of Brittany's daughter, Claude.
[199]

== Emblems and mottos ==
Anne of Brittany had inherited from Anne of Brittany's predecessors the Breton dynastic emblems: a bandwidth Ermine (from John V), a simple Ermine (from John III) and a cord (from Francis II).
[237]As a widow of Charles VIII, and inspired by Anne of Brittany's father, Anne of Brittany founded in 1498 the Order of the Ladies of the Cord.
[238]As a personal emblem, Anne of Brittany also used the letter "A" crowned, with the motto Non mudera ("I will not change") and a particular form of the father's cord, knotted at 8.
[239]Anne of Brittany emblems were joined in the decoration of Anne of Brittany's castles and manuscripts with those of Anne of Brittany's husbands: the flaming sword of Charles VIII and the porcupine of Louis XII.
[240]Anne of Brittany also used the motto Potius Mori Quam Foedari ("Rather die than dishonor") (in Breton "Kentoc'h mervel eget bezañ saotret").

Even while Anne of Brittany was alive, the royal propaganda of Charles VIII and of Louis XII depicted Anne of Brittany as a perfect queen, a symbol of union and peace between the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Brittany (the popular tradition of the "Good Duchess").
[249]In
[250]the
[251]following
[252]centuries
[253], historians and popular culture sometimes presented Anne of Brittany in differing fashions, ascribing to Anne of Brittany's physical and psychological characteristics that are not necessarily supported by historical evidence.
[254]

[255]After Anne of Brittany's death, Anne of Brittany was gradually forgotten until the mid-19th century.
[256]After the foundation of the Breton Association in 1843, Breton regionalists sought a figure which could embody their ideal of agrarian and regional renewal, while expressing their attachment to the French nation.
[257]Their choice was Anne of Brittany (hence the legend of the "Duchess in clogs").Many
[258]myths now surround Anne of Brittany  as a woman forced into an arranged marriage with Charles VIII, the Duchess of Brittany committed to the independence and happiness of Anne of Brittany's country, or otherwise of a Queen symbol of union and peace between Brittany and France.
[259]It has become an issue between those Breton historians pursuing a mythologizing of their past, and those forging a national historiography with the myth of a French nation one and indivisible.
[260]This symbolism explains the release of fifty books during the last 200 years giving contrasting visions of Anne of Brittany  at one extreme there is Georges Minois, who presented Anne of Brittany's as a person "limited, petty and vindictive", and at the other Philippe Tourault, who gave Anne of Brittany's a "quite richly and favorable personality, ardently attached to Anne of Brittany's country and people"
[261].
