[2]

[4]Born in Berlin, Ken Adam relocated to England with Ken Adam's Jewish family at the age of 13 soon after the Nazis came to power.
[5]Together with Ken Adam's younger brother, Denis Adam, Ken Adam was one of only three German-born pilots to serve in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.
[6]


== Early life ==

[7]Ken Adam was born in 1921 in Berlin to an upper-middle-class secular Jewish family, the third child of Lilli (née Saalfeld) and Fritz Adam, a former Prussian cavalry officer who had served with the Zieten Hussars.
[8]Fritz had been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and the Iron Cross First Class for his service in the First World War.
[9]Fritz co-
[10]owned a well-known high-fashion clothing and sporting goods store called S. Adam (Berlin, Leipziger Straße/Friedrichstraße) together with his three brothers, George, Siegfried and Otto Adam.
[11]
The company had been established in 1863 by Saul Adam.
[12]Ken Adam had two older siblings, Peter, Loni and a younger brother Dieter (1 February 1924 – 17 October 2018).The
[13]family lived an almost idyllic, privileged existence until the Nazi Party came to power.
[14]Ken Adam older brother Peter was good friends with Gottfried Reinhardt the son of theatre and film director Max Reinhardt and they would often take Ken Adam out with them.
[15]As a result, Ken Adam got to know Max Reinhardt and many other people in the German theatre.
[16]Gottfried Reinhardt later became a film director and producer.
[17]



[18]===
[19]England ===
The combination of Ken Adam's brother Dieter at the age of nine having a fight with a playground bully wearing a Hitler Youth uniform and the increasing discrimination against Jews convinced their parents to send Ken Adam and Dieter to Craigend Park boarding school in Edinburgh.
[20]Upon arrival Ken Adam anglicised Ken Adam's name to Kenneth and eventually Ken while Ken Adam's brother Dieter changed his to Denis.
[21]Their oldest brother Peter was at the time studying law at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France and decided to move to England and complete his studies there.
[22]

[23]The rest of the Adam family stayed in Germany as Ken Adam father felt that the Nazis were only a temporary aberration and they would wait it out.
[24]Things however continued to deteriorate with Jewish stores being boycotted and targeted for attacks in April 1933.
[25]

[26]During the summer of 1933, Max Reich, a senior employee of the family business, and then Fritz Adam were arrested.
[27]Reich was a member of the SS and leader of the business's Nazi cell.
[28]Reich was eventually released and Fritz Adam was released and put under house arrest for three days.
[29]Inquiries determined that a former employee who had been dismissed for dishonesty had accused the two men of unfair dismissal and conspiring to maintain undeclared funds in Switzerland.
[30]It took two weeks to disprove both allegations and no charges were laid against either man.
[31]

[32]Reluctantly coming to the conclusion that Jews had no future in Germany, Fritz, Ken Adam and Ken Adam  as well as some of Ken Adam aunts and uncles, fled to England in the summer of 1934.
[33]The family eventually settled in the Hampstead area of London the following year.
[34]

[35]The family were declared refugees on their arrival to England and identified as "friendly aliens" with the exception of Denis who was too young to be classified.
[36]The family arrived in England with nothing other than some gold coins Ken Adam had smuggled out.
[37]Ken Adam mother who had never previously worked in Ken Adam's life used the little money they had to establish and run a boarding house.
[38]Ken Adam father struggled with his change in status and starting over in a new country.
[39]Ken Adam father started an import-export business selling gloves but his health deteriorated and he died in 1936 when he was 56 years old.
[40]Ken Adam left the boarding school in Edinburgh to rejoin Ken Adam's parents in London and continued Ken Adam's education at St. Paul's School in London.
[41]At Ken Adam's Ken Adam boarding house Ken Adam became increasingly interested in cinema after coming into contact with a number of artists among the Jewish refugees who were boarding there.
[42]Ken Adam was introduced to Vincent Korda, a Hungarian art director, when Ken Adam was working on Knight Without Armour at Denham Film Studios.
[43]Korda not only nurtured Ken Adam passion for films, but encouraged Ken Adam to train as an architect if Ken Adam was interested in becoming a production designer.
[44]Leaving school Ken Adam became an apprentice at the firm of CW Glover & Partners (which specialized in making bomb shelters) and Ken Adam signed up for evening classes at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London.
[45]Among Ken Adam's tutors was a part-time teacher who had been an assistant of famed German architect Erich Mendelsohn from whom Ken Adam learned valuable architectural drawing techniques.
[46]


== World War II ==
When World War II began, Ken Adam was working on designs for air-raid shelters and illustrated books on air-raid protection and gas masks.
[47]As German citizens, the Adam family could have been interned as enemy aliens, but in October 1940 Ken Adam was able to join the Pioneer Corps, a support unit of the British Army open to citizens of Axis countries resident in the UK and other Commonwealth countries, provided they were not considered a risk to security.
[48]Ken Adam was seconded to design bomb shelters.
[49]
After eight months service in the Pioneer Corps, Ken Adam application to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a pilot was accepted.
[50]After initial flight training on de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes in Scotland, Ken Adam was sent to Canada and the United States for additional training.
[51]Among Ken Adam's instructors was British actor Michael Rennie.
[52]

[53]Ken Adam joined No. 609 Squadron at RAF Lympne on 1 October 1943.
[54]Ken Adam was nicknamed "Heinie the tank-buster" by Ken Adam's comrades for Ken Adam's daring exploits.
[55]The squadron flew the Hawker Typhoon, initially in support of USAAF long-range bombing missions over Europe.
[56]Later they were employed in support of ground troops, including at the battle of the Falaise Gap, in Normandy after D-Day.
[57]In 1944, Ken Adam's brother Denis joined No. 183 Squadron, joining Ken Adam in No. 123 Wing.
[58]There were four squadrons in the wing: 164, 183, 198 and 609.Together
[59]with Ken Adam's brother Denis, Ken Adam was one of three German-born pilots to serve in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, the third being Peter Stevens.
[60]As such, if they had been captured by the Germans, they were liable to execution as traitors rather than being treated as prisoners of war.
[61]Following the end of the war Ken Adam was the Allied officer in charge of German labour rebuilding Wunstorf Air Base.
[62]Ken Adam naturalised as a British subject on 27 December 1946 and left the RAF upon Ken Adam's demobilisation in 1947.
