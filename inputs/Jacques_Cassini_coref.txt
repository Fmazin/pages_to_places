[1]Jacques Cassini (18 February 1677 – 16 April 1756) was a French astronomer, son of the famous Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
[2]Jacques Cassini was known as Cassini II.
[3]

[4]Jacques Cassini was born at the Paris Observatory.
[5]Jacques Cassini was first admitted to Collège Mazarin after brief studies at Jacques Cassini's home observatory under Jacques Cassini's father.
[6]Later, Jacques Cassini was admitted at the age of seventeen to membership of the French Academy of Sciences, Jacques Cassini was elected in 1696 a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and became maître des comptes in 1706.
[7]While in England, Jacques Cassini was acquainted with other famous astronomers such as Newton and Halley.
[8]Having succeeded to Jacques Cassini's father's position at the observatory in 1712, in 1713 Jacques Cassini extended the Paris meridian, measuring the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan, and published the results in a volume entitled Traité de la grandeur et de la figure de la terre (1720).
[9]Jacques Cassini two separate calculations for a degree of meridian arc were 57,097 toises de Paris (111.282 km) and 57,061 toises (111.211 km), giving results for Earth's radius of 3,271,420 toises (6,375.998 km) and 3,269,297 toises (6,371.860 km), respectively.
[10]This work represented Jacques Cassini delve into the Earth figure debate.
[11]There were two main schools of thought, the Cartesians believed in a prolate spheroid, and the Newtonians in an oblate spheroid.
[12]Jacques Cassini sided with the Cartesians over the Newtonians, advocating for a prolate spheroid shaped earth.
[13]The Cartesians had support, but the Newtonians made separate observations seeming to disagree with the Cartesian idea.
[14]Jacques Cassini likely realized that the Newtonian observations were more accurate, and stepped out of the scientific field.
[15]Jacques Cassini only returned publicly after an attack from Anders Celsius.
[16]

[17]For Jacques Cassini's last few years Jacques Cassini took up cartography, working with Jacques Cassini's son, Cassini de Thury or Cassini III, to create a new French map.
[18]This map was known as the Carte de Cassini, and was to be a very accurate map of France.
[19]

[20]Jacques Cassini work on the ballistic pendulum has been a topic of controversy among historians of science.
[21]While some credit Jacques Cassini with developing original work on the topic, others argue that Jacques Cassini built upon the ideas of earlier scientists.
[22]It is difficult to determine the extent of Jacques Cassini original contributions, as the available historical records are vague and incomplete.
[23]However, subsequent work on ballistic pendulums by Benjamin Robins (1707–1751), a British mathematician and engineer, suggests that Jacques Cassini independently repeated many of the same results.
[24]Regardless of the extent of Jacques Cassini original contributions, Jacques Cassini's work on the ballistic pendulum was significant in its time and helped to advance the field of ballistics.
[25]The device allowed for the measurement of the velocity of projectiles, which was important for the development of more accurate firearms and artillery.
[26]Jacques Cassini also wrote Eléments d'astronomie on proper motion (1740), and published the first tables of the satellites of Saturn in 1716.
[27]Jacques Cassini died at Thury, near Clermont, France.
[28]The asteroid 24102 Jacquescassini is named after Jacques Cassini 
[29]

[30]Jacques Cassini married Suzanne Françoise Charpentier de Charmois.
[31]Their second son was astronomer César-François Cassini de Thury, who was also known as Cassini III.
