[32]Early music career =
[33]=
[34]=

[35]Gene Vincent became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk.
[36]Gene Vincent changed Gene Vincent's name to Gene Vincent and formed a rockabilly band, Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy).

[39]Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps soon gained a reputation playing in various country bars in Norfolk.
[40]There they won a talent contest organized by a local radio DJ, "Sheriff Tex" Davis, who then became Gene Vincent manager.
[41]


=== Biggest hits ===
In 1956 Gene Vincent wrote "Be-Bop-a-Lula", which drew comparisons to Elvis Presley and which Rolling Stone magazine later listed as number 103 on its "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".
[42]Local radio DJ "Sheriff Tex" Davis arranged for a demo of the song to be made, and this secured Gene Vincent a contract with Capitol Records.
[43]Gene Vincent signed a publishing contract with Bill Lowery of the Lowery Group of music publishers in Atlanta, Georgia.
[44]"Be-Bop-a-Lula" was not on Gene Vincent first album and was picked by Capitol producer Ken Nelson as the B-side of Gene Vincent's first single, "Woman Love".
[45]Prior to the release of the single, Lowery pressed promotional copies of "Be-Bop-a-Lula" and sent them to radio stations throughout the country.
[46]By the time Capitol released the single, "Be-Bop-a-Lula" had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs.
[47]The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations (obscuring the original A-side song) and became a hit, peaking at number 7 and spending 20 weeks on the Billboard pop chart and reaching number 5 and spending 17 weeks on the Cash Box chart, and launching Gene Vincent career as a rock-and-roll star.
[48]After "Be-Bop-a-Lula" became a hit, Gene Vincent and Gene Vincent Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success, although they released critically acclaimed songs like "Race with the Devil" (number 96 on the Billboard chart and number 50 on the Cash Box chart) and "Bluejean Bop" (number 49 on the Billboard chart and another million-selling
[49]disc).Cliff
[50]Gallup left the band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined as the new guitarist for the Blue Caps.
[51]Williford played and toured Canada with Gene Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957.
[52]Gallup came back to do the next album and then left again.
[53]Williford came back and exited again before Johnny Meeks joined the band.
[54]The group had another hit in 1957 with "Lotta Lovin'" (highest position number 13 and spending 19 weeks on the Billboard chart and number 17 and 17 weeks on the Cashbox chart).
[55]Gene Vincent was awarded gold records for two million sales of "Be-Bop-a-Lula", and 1.5 million sales of "Lotta Lovin'".
[56]The same year Gene Vincent toured the east coast of Australia with Little Richard and Eddie Cochran, drawing audiences totaling 72,000 to their Sydney Stadium concerts.
[57]Gene Vincent also made an appearance in the film The Girl Can't Help It, with Jayne Mansfield, performing "Be-Bop-a-Lula" with the Blue Caps in a rehearsal room.
[58]"Dance to the Bop" was released by Capitol Records on October 28, 1957.
[59]On November 17, 1957, Gene Vincent and Gene Vincent Blue Caps performed the song on the nationally broadcast television program The Ed Sullivan Show.
[60]The song spent nine weeks on the Billboard chart and peaked at number 23 on January 23, 1958 and reached number 36 and spent eight weeks on the Cashbox chart.
[61]It was Gene Vincent last American hit single.
[62]The song was used in the movie Hot Rod Gang for a dance rehearsal scene featuring dancers doing the West Coast Swing.
[63]Gene Vincent and Gene Vincent Blue Caps also appeared several times on Town Hall Party, California's largest country music barn dance, held at the Town Hall in Compton, California.
[64]They appeared on October 25, 1958, and July 25 and November 7, 1959.
[65] However, by the end of 1959 the Blue Caps were no longer part of the billing on Gene Vincent records.
[66] The late 1959 single "Wild Cat" was credited solely to Gene Vincent  and this would be the case on all subsequent Gene Vincent releases.
