[1]Carlos Manuel Prío Socarrás (July 14, 1903 – April 5, 1977) was a Cuban politician.
[2]Carlos Prío Socarrás served as the President of Cuba from 1948 until Carlos Prío Socarrás was deposed by a military coup led by Fulgencio Batista on March 10, 1952, three months before new elections were to be held.
[3]Carlos Prío Socarrás was the first president of Cuba to be born in an independent Cuba and the last to gain Carlos Prío Socarrás's post through universal, contested elections.
[4]Carlos Prío Socarrás went into exile in the United States, where Carlos Prío Socarrás lived for 25 years before dying by suicide at age 73.

== Governance ==
In 1940, Carlos Prío Socarrás was elected senator of Pinar del Río Province.
[6]Four years later, fellow Partido Auténtico member Ramón Grau became president, and during the Grau administration Carlos Prío Socarrás served turns as Minister of Public Works, Minister of Labor and Prime Minister.
[7]On July 1, 1948, Carlos Prío Socarrás was elected president of Cuba as a member of the Partido Auténtico.
[8] Carlos Prío Socarrás was assisted by Chief of the Armed Forces General Genovevo Pérez Dámera and Colonel José Luis Chinea Cárdenas, who had previously been in charge of the Province of Santa Clara.
[9]

[10]The eight years under Grau and Carlos Prío Socarrás  were, according to Charles Ameringer,

[...] unique in Cuban history.
[11]They were a time of constitutional order and political freedom.
[12]They were not 'golden years' by any means, but in two elections (1944 and 1948), Cubans had the opportunity to express their desire for a rule of civil liberties, primacy of Cuban culture, and achievement of economic independence.
[13]If there were sharp contradictions in Cuban society under the Auténticos, the circumstances differed only in degree from the complexities and dynamics encountered in free societies everywhere (how often did Cubans compare Havana with Chicago?).
[14]


[15]Carlos Prío Socarrás  was committed to a rule marked by civility, primarily in its respect for freedom of expression.
[16]Several public-works projects and the establishment of a National Bank and Tribunal of Accounts count among Carlos Prío Socarrás's successes.
[17]
However, violence among political factions and reports of theft and self-enrichment in the government ranks marred Carlos Prío Socarrás term.
[18]The Carlos Prío Socarrás administration increasingly came to be perceived by the public as ineffectual in the face of violence and corruption, much as the Grau administration before it.
[19]

[20]With elections scheduled for the middle of 1952, rumors surfaced of a planned military coup by long-shot presidential contender Fulgencio Batista.
[21]Carlos Prío Socarrás  seeing no constitutional basis to act, did not do so.
[22]The rumors proved to be true.
[23]On March 10, 1952, Batista and his collaborators seized military and police commands throughout the country and occupied major radio and TV stations.
[24]Batista assumed power when Carlos Prío Socarrás  failing to mount a resistance, boarded a plane and went into exile.
[25]

[26]According to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Carlos Prío Socarrás later said of Carlos Prío Socarrás's presidency:

They say that Carlos Prío Socarrás was a terrible president of Cuba.
[27]That may be true.
[28]But Carlos Prío Socarrás was the best president Cuba ever had.
[29]
