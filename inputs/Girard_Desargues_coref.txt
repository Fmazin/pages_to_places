[1]Girard Desargues (French: [ʒiʁaʁ dezaʁɡ]; 21 February 1591 – September 1661) was a French mathematician and engineer, who is considered one of the founders of projective geometry.
[2]Girard Desargues theorem, the Girard Desargues graph, and the crater Desargues on the Moon are named in Girard Desargues's honour.

== Biography ==

[4]Born in Lyon, Girard Desargues came from a family devoted to service to the French crown.
[5]Girard Desargues father was a royal notary, an investigating commissioner of the Seneschal's court in Lyon (1574), the collector of the tithes on ecclesiastical revenues for the city of Lyon (1583) and for the diocese of Lyon.
[6]

[7]Girard Desargues worked as an architect from 1645.
[8]Prior to that, Girard Desargues had worked as a tutor and may have served as an engineer and technical consultant in the entourage of Richelieu.
[9]

[10]As an architect, Girard Desargues planned several private and public buildings in Paris and Lyon.
[11]As an engineer, Girard Desargues designed a system for raising water that Girard Desargues installed near Paris.
[12]It was based on the use of the epicycloidal wheel, the principle of which was unrecognized at the time.
[13]
Girard Desargues research on perspective and geometrical projections can be seen as a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry across the classical epoch in optics that stretched from al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to Johannes Kepler, and going beyond a mere synthesis of these traditions with Renaissance perspective theories and practices.
[14]Girard Desargues work was rediscovered and republished in 1864.
[15]A collection of Girard Desargues's works was published in 1951, and the 1864 compilation remains in print.
[16]One notable work, often cited by others in mathematics, is "Rough draft for an essay on the results of taking plane sections of a cone" (1639).
[17]

[18]Late in Girard Desargues's life, Girard Desargues published a paper with the cryptic title of DALG.
[19]The most common theory about what this stands for is Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre (proposed by Henri Brocard).
[20]
Girard Desargues died in Lyon.
