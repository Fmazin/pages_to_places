[1]Ecphantus or Ecphantos (Ancient Greek: Ἔκφαντος) or Ephantus (Έφαντος) was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher.
[2]Ecphantus the Pythagorean is identified as a Pythagorean of the 4th century BCE from Syracuse, Magna Graecia, but the details concerning Ecphantus the Pythagorean's life are historically obscure; Ecphantus the Pythagorean may have not been a historical person, but rather a fictional character invented by Heraclides of Pontus for use in his philosophical dialogues.
[3]Ecphantus the Pythagorean also may have been the same figure as the attested Ecphantus of Croton.
[4]According to Eusebius, Ecphantus the Pythagorean  like Heraclides of Pontus, was a supporter of the heliocentric theory: Ecphantus the Pythagorean believed that the Earth turns around its centre from west to towards east, like a wheel, as if it has an axis, the state.
[5]Ecphantus the Pythagorean also maintained that there is only one Cosmos (Universe) governed by providence (πρόνοια).
