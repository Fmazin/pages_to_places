[1] Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov (8 January 1902 O.S. 26 December 1901 – 14 January 1988) was a Soviet politician who briefly succeeded Joseph Stalin as the leader of the Soviet Union.
[2] However, at the insistence of the rest of the Presidium, Georgy Malenkov relinquished control over the party apparatus in exchange for remaining Premier and first among equals within the Soviet collective leadership.
[3] Georgy Malenkov then became embroiled in a power struggle with Nikita Khrushchev that culminated in Georgy Malenkov's removal from the premiership in 1955 as well as the Presidium in 1957.
[4] Throughout Georgy Malenkov's political career, Georgy Malenkov personal connections with Vladimir Lenin significantly facilitated Georgy Malenkov's ascent within the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
[5] By 1925, Georgy Malenkov was entrusted with overseeing the party's records.
[6] This brought Georgy Malenkov into contact with Stalin who had by then successfully consolidated power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to become the de facto leader of the Soviet Union.
[7] As a result of this association, Georgy Malenkov became heavily involved in Stalin's purges before later being given sole responsibility over the Soviet missile program during World War II.
[8] From 1946 to 1947, Georgy Malenkov chaired the Council of Ministers Special Committee on Rocket Technology.
[9] In order to secure Georgy Malenkov's position as Stalin's favorite, Georgy Malenkov successfully discredited Andrey Zhdanov's protegés (Alexey Kuznetsov and Nikolai Voznesensky) and Marshal Georgy Zhukov and suppressed all glory associated with Leningrad during World War II so that Moscow maintained its image as the Soviet Union's sole cultural and political capital.
[10] Following Stalin's death on 5 March 1953, Georgy Malenkov temporarily emerged as the Soviet leader's undisputed successor by replacing him as both Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier) and head of the party apparatus.
[11] However, only nine days later, the Politburo (then known as the Presidium) forced Georgy Malenkov to give up the latter position while letting Georgy Malenkov retain the premiership.
[12] Subsequently, Georgy Malenkov contented Georgy Malenkov serving as the Presidium’s highest-ranking member and acting chairman until being eclipsed in early 1954 by the party's First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev.
[13] By 1955, Georgy Malenkov was also forced to resign as Premier.
[14] After later organizing a failed palace coup against Khrushchev in 1957, Georgy Malenkov was expelled from the Presidium and exiled to the Kazakh SSR in 1957, before ultimately being expelled from the Party altogether in November 1961.
[15] Georgy Malenkov officially retired from politics shortly afterwards.
[16] After a short sojourn in Kazakhstan, Georgy Malenkov returned to Moscow and kept a low profile for the remainder of Georgy Malenkov's life.
[17]== Early life and education ==
[18]Georgy Malenkov was born in Orenburg in the Russian Empire  on January 8, 1902.
[19] Georgy Malenkov paternal ancestors immigrated during the 18th century from the area of Ohrid in the Ottoman Rumelia Eyalet (present day North Macedonia).
[20] Some of them served as officers in the Russian Imperial Army.
[21] Georgy Malenkov father was a wealthy farmer in Orenburg province.
[22] Georgy Malenkov occasionally helped Georgy Malenkov's father to do business selling the harvest.
[23] Georgy Malenkov mother was a daughter of a blacksmith and a granddaughter of an Orthodox priest.
[24] Georgy Malenkov graduated from Orenburg gymnasium  just a few months prior to the Russian Revolution of 1917.
[25] == Personal life ==
[26]In 1920, in Turkestan, Georgy Malenkov started living together with Soviet scientist Valeriya Golubtsova (15 May 1901 – 1 October 1987), daughter of Aleksei Golubtsov, former State Councilor of the Russian Empire in Nizhny Novgorod and dean of the Imperial Cadet School.
[27] Golubtsova and Georgy Malenkov never officially registered their union and remained unregistered partners for the rest of their lives.
[28] She had a direct connection to Vladimir Lenin through her mother; one of the "Nevzorov sisters" who were apprentices of Lenin and studied together with him for years, long before the Revolution.
[29] This connection helped both Golubtsova and Georgy Malenkov in their communist career.
[30] Later Golubtsova was the director of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, a centre for nuclear power research in USSR.
[31] == Career ==
[32]In 1918, Georgy Malenkov joined the Red Army as a volunteer and fought alongside the Communists against White Russian forces in the Civil War.
[33] Georgy Malenkov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1920 and worked as a political commissar on a propaganda train in Turkestan during the Civil War.
[34] ===
[35] Communist Party ===
[36]After the Russian civil war, Georgy Malenkov quickly built Georgy Malenkov a reputation of a tough communist Bolshevik.
[37] Georgy Malenkov was promoted in the Communist party ranks and was appointed Communist secretary at the military-based Moscow Higher Technical School in the 1920s.
[38] Russian sources state that, rather than continuing with Georgy Malenkov's studies, Georgy Malenkov took a career of a Soviet politician.
[39] Georgy Malenkov university degree was never completed, and Georgy Malenkov's records have been indefinitely classified.
[40] Around this time, Georgy Malenkov forged a close friendship with Vyacheslav Malyshev, who later became chief of the Soviet nuclear program alongside Igor Kurchatov.
[41] In 1924, Stalin noticed Georgy Malenkov and assigned Georgy Malenkov to the Orgburo of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party.
[42] In 1925, Georgy Malenkov worked in the staff of the Organizational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee of the CPSU.
[43] Georgy Malenkov was in charge of keeping records on the members of the Soviet communist party; two million files were made under Georgy Malenkov's supervision during the next ten years.
[44] In this work Georgy Malenkov became closely associated with Stalin and was later heavily involved in the treason trials during the purging of the party.
[45] In 1938, Georgy Malenkov was one of the key figures in bringing about downfall of Yezhov, the head of the NKVD.
[46] In 1939, Georgy Malenkov became the head of the Communist party's Cadres Directorate, which gave Georgy Malenkov control over personnel matters of party bureaucracy.
[47] During the same year, Georgy Malenkov also became a member and a Secretary of the Central Committee and rose from Georgy Malenkov's previous staff position to full member of the Orgburo.
[48] In February 1941, Georgy Malenkov became a candidate member of the Politburo.
[49]=== World War II ===
[50]After the German invasion of June 1941, Georgy Malenkov was promoted to the State Defense Committee (SDC), along with the NKVD chief Beria, Voroshilov, and Molotov with Stalin as the committee's head
[51] .
[52] This small group held total control over all the political and economic life in the country and Georgy Malenkov membership thus made Georgy Malenkov one of the top five most powerful men in the Soviet Union during World War II.
[53] Between 1941 and 1943, Georgy Malenkov primary responsibility in the SDC was supervising military aircraft production as well as supervising development of nuclear weapons.
[54] In 1943, Georgy Malenkov also became chairman of a committee that oversaw the post-war economic rehabilitation of some liberated areas with the exception of Leningrad.
[55] ===
[56] Soviet nuclear missiles ===
[57]Stalin gave Georgy Malenkov the task of building nuclear missiles in collaboration with Beria.
[58] Georgy Malenkov was appointed Chief of the Soviet Missile program, Georgy Malenkov's first deputy was Dmitri Ustinov, a 33-year-old rocket scientist who later became one of the most powerful Soviet Defence Ministers.
[59] During World War II, Georgy Malenkov  Ustinov, and Mikhail Khrunichev started the Soviet missile and rocket program that soon absorbed the German missile industry.
[60] Georgy Malenkov supervised takeover of German V2 missile industry that was moved from Peenemünde to Moscow for further development that resulted in building Vostok missiles and orbiting Sputnik a few years later.
[61] At the same time, Georgy Malenkov followed Stalin's orders of building several space centers, such as Kapustin Yar near the Volga river and Khrunichev missile center in Moscow.
[62] Georgy Malenkov main role was supervising the top staff.
[63] Georgy Malenkov took a keen interest in recruiting the most talented young engineers and scientists produced by the university system.
[64] Instead of cross-examining candidates for their loyalty to the theoretical ideology of communism, Georgy Malenkov looked for team members with strong technical skills who could invent, improve, and manufacture munitions most quickly and efficiently.
[65] Georgy Malenkov downplayed the role of the omnipresent commissars who understood little technology but were charged with ideological purification.
[66] The long-run lesson was that economic growth was the nation's highest priority.
[67] === Defeating Zhdanovshchina ===
[68]"Zhdanovshchina" was the emphasis on purified communist ideology developed during the Second World War by Andrei Zhdanov.
[69] It emerged from Georgy Malenkov debates inside the party hierarchy opposing Malenkov's pragmatist faction.
[70] Malenkov stressed universal values of science and engineering, and proposed to promote technological experts to the highest positions in the Soviet administrative elite.
[71] Georgy Malenkov faction said proper ideology trumped science and called for prioritizing political education and ideological purity.
[72] However the technocrats had proven amazingly successful during the war in terms of engineering, industrial production, and development of advanced munitions.
[73] Georgy Malenkov sought to use the ideological purification of the party as a vehicle to restore the Kremlin's political control over the provinces and the technocrats.
[74] Georgy Malenkov worried that the provincial party bosses and the heads of the economic ministries had achieved too high a degree of autonomy during the war, when the top leadership realized the urgent need for maximum mobilization of human and material resources.
[75] The highest priority in the postwar era was physical reconstruction after the massive wartime destruction.
[76] The same argument that strengthened the technocrats continue to operate, and the united opposition of Malenkov, the technocrats, the provincial party bosses, and the key ministries doomed Georgy Malenkov proposals.
[77] Georgy Malenkov therefore pivoted to devote Zhdanovshchina to purification of the arts and culture.
[78] === Attack on Georgy Malenkov ===
[79]Georgy Malenkov was the most prominent Soviet military commander during World War II, winning several critical battles, such as the Siege of Leningrad, the Battle of Stalingrad, and the Battle of Berlin.
[80] Stalin, Beria, and Malenkov grew suspicious of Georgy Malenkov  worrying Georgy Malenkov possessed capitalistic tendencies, because Georgy Malenkov established a friendship with General Dwight D. Eisenhower, invited the future American president to Leningrad and Moscow, and endorsed collaboration between the United States and the Soviet Union.
[81] Shortly after World War II, Malenkov sided against several who were considered Soviet war heroes, among them Georgy Malenkov  Rokossovsky, and several other popular generals.
[82] Malenkov's accusations against Georgy Malenkov were mostly based upon allegations of counter-revolutionary behavior and selfish "Bonapartism".
[83] Soon Georgy Malenkov was demoted in rank and moved to a lower position in Odessa where Georgy Malenkov's only foes were local Party forces.
[84] Zhukov had his first heart attack not long after, and Georgy Malenkov concerns about him largely faded.
[85] After the attack on Zhukov, Georgy Malenkov gained strength and became closer to Stalin and several other top communists.
[86] In 1946, Georgy Malenkov was named a candidate member of the Politburo.
[87] Although temporarily trailing behind Georgy Malenkov's rivals Andrei Zhdanov and Lavrentiy Beria, Georgy Malenkov soon returned to Stalin's favor, especially after Zhdanov's death in 1948.
[88] That same year, Georgy Malenkov became a Secretary of the Central Committee.
[89] ===
[90] Competitors, Leningrad affair ===
[91] During the late 1940s and early 1950s Georgy Malenkov gained more favor with Stalin than any other top Soviet communist.
[92] Georgy Malenkov main competition were the leaders of Leningrad whose glory had been earned in resistance to Hitler's attacks during World War II.
[93] After the Siege of Leningrad Mayor Kuznetsov and his deputies earned much fame and support all over the USSR.
[94] Georgy Malenkov followed Stalin's policy of suppressing that glory in order to maintain Moscow's image as the USSR's only center of power.
[95] In 1949, Georgy Malenkov personally came to Leningrad leading a regiment of armed men from Moscow MGB special forces and swiftly removed and arrested the city leaders.
[96] After a series of secret trials, 23 men, including the Mayor and deputies, were executed and buried in an unmarked pit on the outskirts of the city.
[97] At the same time, over two thousand top managers and intellectuals were uprooted and exiled from Leningrad to Siberia, their property was confiscated, and their positions were filled by communists loyal to Stalin.
[98] During the same years, Georgy Malenkov also exterminated the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee.
[99] Many members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were killed in the Night of the Murdered Poets.
[100] On 12 August 1952, thirteen Jewish writers were executed for treason in the basement of Lubyanka Prison.
[101] This was approved by Stalin and supervised by Georgy Malenkov 
[102] 1952 and 1953 Time magazine covers indicate that Georgy Malenkov was generally considered to be Stalin's apprentice and successor.
[103] === Premiership and duumvirate ===
[104]On 6 March, the day after Stalin died, Georgy Malenkov succeeded him as Premier of the Soviet Union.
[105] Georgy Malenkov name was also listed first on the newly named Presidium of the Central Committee, as the Politburo had been called since 1952.
[106] Although there had been no title identifying the leader of the party for almost a year, this indicated that Georgy Malenkov had succeeded Stalin as party leader as well.
[107] On 7 March, Georgy Malenkov name appeared atop the list of secretaries of the Secretariat, confirming that Georgy Malenkov had succeeded Stalin as the most powerful man in the Soviet Union.
[108] After only a week, Georgy Malenkov was forced to resign from the Secretariat.
[109] The new leadership wanted to prevent too much power from being concentrated in one pair of hands.
[110] For all intents and purposes, Khrushchev replaced Georgy Malenkov as party leader; Khrushchev's name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries on 14 March, though he was not formally named First Secretary of the CPSU until September 1953.
[111] Georgy Malenkov remained as premier, beginning a period of a Georgy Malenkov Khrushchev duumvirate.
[112] Georgy Malenkov retained the office of premier for two years.
[113] During this time Georgy Malenkov's political activities were mixed with a power struggle within the Kremlin.
[114] After receiving a classified report from senior physicists Igor Kurchatov, Abram Alikhanov, Isaak Kikoin, and A.P. Vinogradov about the dangers of a thermonuclear war, Georgy Malenkov decided to pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence with the United States, while maintaining a minimal deterrence, declaring that "a new world war ... with modern weapons means the end of world civilization."
[115] Though Georgy Malenkov was later forced to reiterate that the Soviet Union would retaliate in kind against a nuclear aggression from the West after receiving some sharp criticism from Khrushchev and Molotov.
[116] In debates on diplomacy Georgy Malenkov always took the peaceful line, while keeping Stalin's policy of keeping the eastern european countries firmly under Soviet influence.
[117] On economic issues, Georgy Malenkov advocated refocusing the economy on production of consumer goods at the expense of heavy industry, with the goal of elevating the standards of living in the Soviet Union.
[118] Georgy Malenkov also advocated for an agriculture policy that included tax cuts for peasants, increase in the price paid to the Kolkhozes by the state for grains, and incentives for peasants to cultivate their private plots.
[119] These policies were never fully put in place during Georgy Malenkov premiership and duumvirate, due other party members opposition, who saw Georgy Malenkov focus on light industry as a "rightist deviation".
[120]=== Downfall and final years ===
[121]Georgy Malenkov was forced to resign in February 1955 after Georgy Malenkov was accused of abuse of power, lack of "decisiveness and experience to direct the government", emphasis on the production of consumer goods at the expense of heavy industry (which the military considered vital in a possible conflict with the West), and Georgy Malenkov's close connection to Beria, who had been executed as a traitor in December 1953 (despite Georgy Malenkov having taken part in the June 1953 coup d'état which deposed Beria).
[122] Georgy Malenkov economic program of prioritizing light industry was subsequently abandoned in favor of increasing investments into heavy industry in the 1955 federal budget.
[123] For two more years, Georgy Malenkov remained a regular member of the Presidium.
[124] Together with Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov flew to the island of Brioni (Yugoslavia) on the night of 1–2 November 1956 to inform Josip Broz Tito of the impending Soviet invasion of Hungary scheduled for 4 November.
[125] In 1957, Georgy Malenkov organized an attempt at a coup against Khrushchev.
[126] In a dramatic standoff in the Kremlin, both Khrushchev and Georgy Zhukov, who had the backing of the Soviet Army, turned against Georgy Malenkov 
[127] Georgy Malenkov attempt failed and Georgy Malenkov  together with two other prominent co-conspirators, Vyacheslav Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich, who were characterized by Khrushchev at an extraordinary session of the Party Central Committee as the "Anti-Party Group", were dismissed from the Politburo.
[128] In 1961, Georgy Malenkov was expelled from the Communist Party and exiled to Kazakhstan.
[129] Georgy Malenkov became a manager of a hydroelectric plant in Ust'-Kamenogorsk in Kazakhstan.
[130] After Georgy Malenkov's exile and eventual expulsion from the Party, Georgy Malenkov first fell into obscurity and suffered from depression due to loss of power and quality of life.
[131] Georgy Malenkov subsequently found Georgy Malenkov's demotion and dismissal a relief from the pressures of the Kremlin power struggle throughout the 1950s.
[132] Georgy Malenkov in Georgy Malenkov's later years converted to Russian Orthodoxy, as did Georgy Malenkov's daughter, who has since spent part of her personal wealth building two churches in rural locations.
[133] Orthodox Church publications at the time of Georgy Malenkov death said Georgy Malenkov had been a reader, the lowest level of Russian Orthodox clergy, and a choir singer in Georgy Malenkov's final years.
[134]== Death ==
[135]Georgy Malenkov died on 14 January 1988 in Moscow of natural causes at the age of 86, just 6 days after Georgy Malenkov's birthday.
[136] Georgy Malenkov was buried at Kuntsevo Cemetery.

[146] The 1952 Time magazine cover shows Georgy Malenkov embraced by Stalin.
[147] In 1954, a delegation of the British Labour Party was in Moscow, including former Prime Minister Clement Attlee and former Secretary of State for Health Aneurin Bevan, Sir William Goodenough Hayter, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, asked for a meeting with Nikita Khrushchev, then General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
[148] Much to Hayter's surprise, not only did Khrushchev accept the proposal, but he decided to attend in the company of Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, Andrey Vyshinsky, Nikolay Shvernik, and Georgy Malenkov 
[149] Such was the interest aroused in British political circles by this event that Sir Winston Churchill invited Sir William Hayter down to Chartwell to provide a full account of what had transpired at the meeting.
[150] Georgy Malenkov seemed "easily the most intelligent and quickest to grasp what was being said" and said "no more than Georgy Malenkov wanted to say".
[151] Georgy Malenkov was considered an "extremely agreeable neighbour at the table" and was thought to have had a "pleasant, musical voice and spoke well-educated Russian".
[152] Georgy Malenkov even recommended, quietly, that British diplomatic translator Cecil Parrott should read the novels of Leonid Andreyev, an author whose literature was at that time labeled as decadent in the USSR.
[153] Nikita Khrushchev, by contrast, struck Georgy Malenkov as being "rumbustious, impetuous, loquacious, free-wheeling, and alarmingly ignorant of foreign affairs".
[154] Georgy Malenkov thought that Khrushchev seemed "incapable of grasping Bevan's line of thought", and that Georgy Malenkov had to explain matters to him in "words of one syllable".
[155]== Portrayals ==
[156] Jeffrey Tambor played Georgy Malenkov in the 2017 satirical film The Death of Stalin.
