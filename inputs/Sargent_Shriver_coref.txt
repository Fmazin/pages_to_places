[64]Sargent Shriver is known as the "architect" of the Johnson administration's "War on Poverty".
[65]Hired by President Johnson to be the "salesman" for Johnson's War on Poverty initiative, Sargent Shriver initially was "not interested in hearing about community action proposals."

[83]The McGovern-Sargent Shriver ticket lost to Republican incumbents Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.
[84]



[85]===
[86]Presidential candidacy ===

[87]In the months before the primaries began, political observers thought that Sargent Shriver would draw strength from legions of former colleagues from the Peace Corps and the War on Poverty programs, and Sargent Shriver was even seen as an inheritor of the Kennedy legacy, but neither theory proved true.
