[1]Albert Imre Szent-Györgyi de Nagyrápolt (Hungarian: nagyrápolti Szent-Györgyi Albert Imre; September 16, 1893 – October 22, 1986) was a Hungarian biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937.
[2]Albert Szent-Györgyi is credited with first isolating vitamin C and discovering many of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle and the molecular basis of muscle contraction.
[3]Albert Szent-Györgyi was also active in the Hungarian Resistance during World War II, and entered Hungarian politics after the war.
[4]


== Early life =
[5]=
Albert Szent-Györgyi was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary in 1893.
[6]Albert Szent-Györgyi father, Miklós Szent-Györgyi, was a landowner, born in Marosvásárhely, Transylvania (today Târgu Mureş, Romania), a Calvinist, and could trace his ancestry back to 1608 when Sámuel, a Calvinist predicant, was ennobled.
[7]At the time of Albert Szent-Györgyi birth, being of the nobility was considered important and created opportunities that otherwise were not available.
[8](Miklós Szent-Györgyi's parents were Imre Szent-Györgyi and Mária Csiky).
[9]Albert Szent-Györgyi mother, Jozefina, a Roman Catholic, was a daughter of József Lenhossék and Anna Bossányi.
[10] 
[11]Jozefina was a sister of Mihály Lenhossék; both of these men were Professors of Anatomy at the Eötvös Loránd University.
[12]Albert Szent-Györgyi family included three generations of scientists.
[13]Music was important in the Lenhossék family.
[14]Albert Szent-Györgyi mother Jozefina prepared to become an opera singer and auditioned for Gustav Mahler, then a conductor at the Budapest Opera.
[15]He advised her to marry instead, since her voice was not enough.
[16]Albert Szent-Györgyi Albert Szent-Györgyi was good at the piano, while Albert Szent-Györgyi's brother Pál became a professional violinist.
[17]


== Education ==
Albert Szent-Györgyi began Albert Szent-Györgyi's studies at the Semmelweis University in 1911, and then began research in Albert Szent-Györgyi's uncle's anatomy lab.
[18]Albert Szent-Györgyi studies were interrupted in 1914 to serve as an army medic in World War I. In 1916, disgusted with the war, Albert Szent-Györgyi shot Albert Szent-Györgyi in the arm, claimed to be wounded from enemy fire, and was sent home on medical leave.
[19]Albert Szent-Györgyi was then able to finish Albert Szent-Györgyi's medical education and received Albert Szent-Györgyi's MD in 1917.
[20]Albert Szent-Györgyi married Kornélia Demény, the daughter of the Hungarian Postmaster General, that same year.
[21]After the war, Albert Szent-Györgyi began Albert Szent-Györgyi's research career in Pozsony (today Bratislava, Slovakia).
[22]Albert Szent-Györgyi switched universities several times over the next few years, finally ending up at the University of Groningen, where Albert Szent-Györgyi's work focused on the chemistry of cellular respiration.
[23]This work landed Albert Szent-Györgyi a position as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the University of Cambridge.
[24]Albert Szent-Györgyi received Albert Szent-Györgyi's PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1929 where Albert Szent-Györgyi was a student at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.
[25]Albert Szent-Györgyi research involved isolating an organic acid, which Albert Szent-Györgyi then called "hexuronic acid", from adrenal gland tissue.
[26]



[27]==
[28]Career
[29]and
[30]research =
[31]=
Albert Szent-Györgyi accepted a position at the University of Szeged in Hungary in 1930.
[32]There Albert Szent-Györgyi and Albert Szent-Györgyi's research fellow Joseph Svirbely found that "hexuronic acid" was actually the thus far unidentified antiscorbutic factor, known as vitamin C.
[33]After Walter Norman Haworth had determined the structure of vitamin C, and in honour of its antiscorbutic properties, it was given the formal chemical name of L-ascorbic acid.
[34]In some experiments they used paprika as the source for their vitamin C.
[35]Also during this time, Albert Szent-Györgyi continued Albert Szent-Györgyi's work on cellular respiration, identifying fumaric acid and other steps in what would become known as the Krebs cycle.
[36]In Szeged Albert Szent-Györgyi also met Zoltán Bay, physicist, who became Albert Szent-Györgyi's personal friend and partner in research on matters of bio-physics.
[37]In 1937 Albert Szent-Györgyi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for Albert Szent-Györgyi's discoveries in connection with the biological combustion process with special reference to vitamin C and the catalysis of fumaric acid".
[38]Albert Szent-Györgyi offered all of Albert Szent-Györgyi's Nobel prize money to Finland in 1940.
[39](Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War travelled to fight for the Finns after the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939.)
[40]

[41]In 1938 Albert Szent-Györgyi began work on the biophysics of muscle movement.
[42]Albert Szent-Györgyi found that muscles contain actin, which when combined with the protein myosin and the energy source ATP, contract muscle fibers.
[43]In 1946, Albert Szent-Györgyi received the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.
[44]

[45]In 1947 Albert Szent-Györgyi established the Institute for Muscle Research at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts with financial support from Hungarian businessman Stephen Rath.
[46]However,  Albert Szent-Györgyi still faced funding difficulties for several years, due to Albert Szent-Györgyi's foreign status and former association with the government of a Communist nation.
[47]In 1948, Albert Szent-Györgyi received a research position with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland and began dividing Albert Szent-Györgyi's time between there and Woods Hole.
[48]In 1950, grants from the Armour Meat Company and the American Heart Association allowed Albert Szent-Györgyi to establish the Institute for Muscle Research at Woods Hole.
[49]Albert Szent-Györgyi conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986 year-round.
[50]There, Albert Szent-Györgyi found that whole muscle tissue retained its contractility almost indefinitely if stored cold in a fifty percent glycerol solution, thus eliminating the need to have fresh muscle on hand.
[51]During the 1950s Albert Szent-Györgyi began using electron microscopes to study muscles at the subunit level.
[52]Albert Szent-Györgyi received the Lasker Award in 1954.
[53] 
[54]In 1955, Albert Szent-Györgyi became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
[55]Albert Szent-Györgyi was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1956.
[56]In 1941, Albert Szent-Györgyi developed a research interest in cancer and developed ideas on applying the theories of quantum mechanics to the biochemistry (quantum biology) of cancer.
[57]The death of Rath, who had acted as the financial administrator of the Institute for Muscle Research, left Albert Szent-Györgyi in a financial mess.
[58]Albert Szent-Györgyi refused to submit government grants which required Albert Szent-Györgyi to provide minute details on exactly how Albert Szent-Györgyi intended to spend the research dollars and what Albert Szent-Györgyi expected to find.
[59]After Albert Szent-Györgyi commented on Albert Szent-Györgyi's financial hardships in a 1971 newspaper interview, attorney Franklin Salisbury contacted Albert Szent-Györgyi and later helped Albert Szent-Györgyi establish a private nonprofit organization, the National Foundation for Cancer Research.
[60]Late in life, Albert Szent-Györgyi began to pursue free radicals as a potential cause of cancer.
[61]Albert Szent-Györgyi came to see cancer as being ultimately an electronic problem at the molecular level.
[62]  
[63]In 1974, reflecting Albert Szent-Györgyi's interests in quantum physics, Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed the term "syntropy" replace the term "negentropy".
[64]Ralph Moss, a protégé of Albert Szent-Györgyi's in the years Albert Szent-Györgyi performed Albert Szent-Györgyi's cancer research, wrote a biography entitled Free Radical: Albert Szent-Györgyi and the Battle over Vitamin C.
[65]Aspects of this work are an important precursor to what is now dubbed redox signaling.
[66]



[67]=== Statement on scientific discovery ===
Albert Szent-Györgyi " divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians.
[68]Albert Szent-Györgyi called Dionysians the scientific dissenters who explore "the fringes of knowledge".
[69]Albert Szent-Györgyi wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...
[70]The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find.
[71]Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."


=== Involvement in politics ===
As the government of Gyula Gömbös and the associated Hungarian National Defence Association gained control of politics in Hungary, Albert Szent-Györgyi helped Albert Szent-Györgyi's Jewish friends escape from the country.
[72]During World War II, Albert Szent-Györgyi joined the Hungarian resistance movement.
[73]Although Hungary was allied with the Axis Powers, the Hungarian prime minister Miklós Kállay sent Albert Szent-Györgyi to Istanbul in 1944 under the guise of a scientific lecture to begin secret negotiations with the Allies.
[74]The Germans learned of this plot and Adolf Hitler himself issued a warrant for the arrest of Albert Szent-Györgyi 
[75]Albert Szent-Györgyi escaped from house arrest and spent 1944 to 1945 as a fugitive from the Gestapo.
[76]

[77]After the war, Albert Szent-Györgyi had become well-recognized as a public figure and there was some speculation that Albert Szent-Györgyi might become President of Hungary, should the Soviets permit it.
[78]Albert Szent-Györgyi established a laboratory at the University of Budapest and became head of the biochemistry department there.
[79]Albert Szent-Györgyi was elected a member of Parliament and helped re-establish the Academy of Sciences.
[80]Dissatisfied with the Communist rule of Hungary, Albert Szent-Györgyi emigrated to the United States in 1947.
[81]

[82]In 1967, Albert Szent-Györgyi signed a letter declaring Albert Szent-Györgyi's intention to refuse to pay taxes as a means of protesting against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to take a similar stand.
[83]Albert Szent-Györgyi was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution.
[84]As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.
