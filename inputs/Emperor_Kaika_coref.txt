[1]Emperor Kaika (開化天皇, Kaika-tennō), also known as Wakayamato Nekohiko Ōbibi no Mikoto (若倭根子日子大毘毘命) in the Kojiki, and Wakayamato Nekohiko Ōbibi no Sumeramikoto (稚日本根子彦大日日天皇) in the Nihon Shoki was the ninth legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
[2]Very little is known about Emperor Kaika due to a lack of material available for further verification and study.
[3]Emperor Kaika is known as a "legendary emperor" among historians as Emperor Kaika's actual existence is disputed.
[4]Nothing exists in the Kojiki other than Emperor Kaika's name and genealogy.
[5]Emperor Kaika reign allegedly began in 158 BC.
[6]Emperor Kaika had one wife and three consorts whom Emperor Kaika fathered five children with.
[7]After Emperor Kaika's death in 98 BC, one of Emperor Kaika's sons supposedly became Emperor Sujin.
[8]


== Legendary narrative ==
In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, only Emperor Kaika name and genealogy were recorded.
[9]The Japanese have traditionally accepted Emperor Kaika historical existence, and an Imperial misasagi or tomb for Emperor Kaika is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that Emperor Kaika actually reigned.
[10]Emperor Kaika was born sometime in 208 BC, and is recorded as being the second son of Emperor Kōgen.
[11]Emperor Kaika empress mother was named Utsushikome, who was the daughter of Oyakuchisukune.
[12]Before Emperor Kaika was enthroned sometime in 158 BC, Emperor Kaika's pre-ascension name was Prince Nikohiko Ō-hibi no Mikoto.
[13]The Kojiki records that Emperor Kaika ruled from the palace of Sakaihara-no-miya (軽之堺原宮, and in the Nihon Shoki as 軽境原宮) at Karu in what would come to be known as Yamato Province.
[14]Emperor Kaika had a chief wife (empress) named Ikagashikome, along with three consorts of which Emperor Kaika fathered five children with.
[15]Emperor Kaika ruled until Emperor Kaika's death in 98 BC; Emperor Kaika's second son was then enthroned as the next emperor.
[16]Emperor Kaika son/heir to the throne was posthumously named Sujin by later generations, and is the first emperor that historians say might have actually existed.
[17]


== Known information ==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study.
[18]Emperor Kaika is thus regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor", and is considered to have been the eighth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them.
[19]The name Kaika-tennō was assigned to Emperor Kaika posthumously by later generations.
[20]
 Emperor Kaika name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Emperor Kaika  possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the Kojiki.
[21]While the actual site of Emperor Kaika grave is not known, Emperor Kaika is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) in Nara.
[22]The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Emperor Kaika mausoleum, and its formal name is Kasuga no Izakawa no saka no e no misasagi.
[23]Like Emperor Kōshō and Emperor Kōrei, there is a possibility that Emperor Kaika could have lived instead in the 1st century (AD).
[24]Historian Louis Frédéric notes this idea in his book Japan Encyclopedia where he says "more likely early AD", but this remains disputed among other researchers.
[25]The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan.
[26]Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c. 509 – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.
[27]The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
