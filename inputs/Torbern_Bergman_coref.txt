[1]Torbern Olaf (Olof) Bergman (KVO) (20 March 1735 – 8 July 1784) was a Swedish chemist and mineralogist noted for Torbern Bergman's 1775 Dissertation on Elective Attractions, containing the largest chemical affinity tables ever published.
[2] Torbern Bergman was the first chemist to use the A, B, C, etc., system of notation for chemical species.
[3]


== Early life and education ==
Torbern Bergman was born on 20 March 1735, the son of Barthold Bergman and Sara Hägg.
[4]Torbern Bergman enrolled at the University of Uppsala at age 17.
[5]Torbern Bergman father wished Torbern Bergman to read either law or divinity, while Torbern Bergman Torbern Bergman was anxious to study mathematics and natural science; in the effort to please both Torbern Bergman and Torbern Bergman's father, Torbern Bergman overworked Torbern Bergman and harmed Torbern Bergman's health.
[6]During a period of enforced abstinence from study, Torbern Bergman amused Torbern Bergman with field botany and entomology.
[7]Torbern Bergman was able to send Linnaeus specimens of several new kinds of insects, and in 1756 Torbern Bergman succeeded in proving that, contrary to the opinion of that naturalist, the so-called Coccus aquaticus was really the ovum of a kind of leech.
[8]Torbern Bergman returned to the university in 1758, and received Torbern Bergman's PhD in that year.

[10]== Career ==
Torbern Bergman lectured at the University of Uppsala on physics and mathematics, publishing papers on the rainbow, the aurora, the pyroelectric phenomena of tourmaline.
[11]Upon the resignation of the celebrated Johan Wallerius, Torbern Bergman was a candidate for the professorship of chemistry and mineralogy.
[12]Torbern Bergman competitors charged Torbern Bergman with ignorance of the subject, because Torbern Bergman had never written on it.
[13]To refute them, Torbern Bergman shut Torbern Bergman up for some time in a laboratory, and prepared a treatise on the manufacture of alum, which became a standard work.
[14]Thanks to the influence of Gustav III, then crown prince and chancellor of the university, Torbern Bergman was appointed a professor of chemistry, and remained at this position for the rest of Torbern Bergman's life.
[15]Torbern Bergman greatly contributed to the advancement of quantitative analysis, and Torbern Bergman developed a mineral classification scheme based on chemical characteristics and appearance.
[16]Torbern Bergman is noted for Torbern Bergman's research on the chemistry of metals, especially bismuth and nickel.
[17]

[18]In 1764, Torbern Bergman was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
[19]In April 1765 Torbern Bergman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.
[20]In 1773 Torbern Bergman was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.
[21]In March 1782, Torbern Bergman was elected Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Sciences.
[22]In 1771, six years after Torbern Bergman first discovered carbonated water and four years after Joseph Priestley first created artificially carbonated water, Torbern Bergman perfected a process to make carbonated water from chalk by the action of sulphuric acid.
[23]Torbern Bergman is also noted for Torbern Bergman's sponsorship of Carl Wilhelm Scheele, whom some deem to be Torbern Bergman "greatest discovery".
[24]The translation into English of Torbern Bergman's book Physical and Chemical Essays was read widely and regarded as the first systematic method of chemical analysis.


== Personal life ==
In 1771, Torbern Bergman married Margareta Catharina Trast.


== Legacy ==
In Torbern Bergman honour, the uranium mineral torbernite and the lunar crater Bergman both bear Torbern Bergman's name.
