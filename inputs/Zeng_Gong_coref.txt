[2]Zeng Gong was one of the supporters of the New Classical Prose Movement (新古文運動) and is regarded by later scholars as one of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song (唐宋八大家).
[3]

[4]Zeng Gong was born in Nanfeng, Jianchang (modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi).
[5]Zeng Gong is said to have written Liulun 六論 ("Six arguments") when Zeng Gong was only twelve.
[6]After the work was praised by Ouyang Xiu, one of the intellectual leaders of the era, Zeng Gong became widely known among literary circles.

[8]In 1037, at the age of eighteen, Zeng Gong moved to Yushan county (玉山縣, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) to accompany Zeng Gong's father Zeng Yizhan (曾易占), who had been appointed magistrate there.
[9]Whilst in Yushan, Zeng Gong travelled extensively in its hinterlands and wrote You Xinzhou Yushan Xiaoyan Ji (遊信州玉山小岩記).
[10]The work was divided into five sections.
[11]The first describes the geography of Yushan, followed by sections on the caves, rocks etc.
[12]Zeng Gong youthful descriptions show Zeng Gong's vivid imagination and literary talent.
[13]In Zeng Gong's twenties, Zeng Gong traveled throughout China, befriending the would be reformer Wang Anshi and later recommending him to Ouyang Xiu.

[15]In 1057, Zeng Gong achieved the degree of jinshi and was appointed to a military post in the provinces.

[17]From 1069, Zeng Gong was appointed successively as the head of Qizhou (齊州), Xiangzhou (襄州), Hongzhou, Fuzhou, Mingzhou (明州) and Bozhou.
[18]

[19]In 1080, en route to a fresh appointment in Cangzhou, Zeng Gong was granted an audience with Emperor Shenzong.
[20]The emperor was suitably impressed and allowed Zeng Gong to stay at the capital to work on a history of the Five Dynasties period.

[23]The new monarch Emperor Lizong granted Zeng Gong the posthumous appellation of "Wending" (文定).
[24]

[25]Zeng Gong produced some four hundred poems in Zeng Gong's lifetime and a number of essays.
[26]Zeng Gong style of prose writing is mostly discursive rather than argumentative.
[27]In terms of political philosophy, Zeng Gong was a firm follower of Ouyang Xiu.
[28]For this reason Zeng Gong's reputation as leader of one of the eight great schools of philosophy has largely been overshadowed by that of Zeng Gong's mentor.
[29]Among Zeng Gong collected works are fifty chapters of Yuanfeng Leigao (元豐類稿), forty chapters of the Xu Yuanfeng Leigao (續元豐類稿) and thirty chapters of the Longping Ji (隆平集).
