[1]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 1st Count Jourdan (29 April 1762 – 23 November 1833), was a French military commander who served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.
[2]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was made a Marshal of the Empire by Emperor Napoleon I in 1804.
[3]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was also a Jacobin politician during the Directory phase of the French Revolution, serving as member of the Council of Five Hundred between 1797 and 1799.One of the most successful commanders of the French Revolutionary Army, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan is best remembered in the Revolution for leading the French to a decisive victory over the First Coalition at the Battle of Fleurus, during the Flanders campaign.
[4]Under the Empire Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was rewarded by Napoleon with the title of Marshal and continued to hold military assignments, but suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Vitoria, which resulted in the Empire's permanent loss of Spain.
[5]In 1815 Jean-Baptiste Jourdan became reconciled with the Bourbon Restoration, and later supported the July Revolution and served in Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's last years as governor of the Hôtel des Invalides.
[6]



[7]== Early life ==
Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was born in Limoges, in the province of Limousin, on 29 April 1762.
[8]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was the only surviving child of Roch Jourdan, a surgeon originally from Meyrargues, and Jeanne Foreau-Franciquet.
[9]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan mother died at childbirth when Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was two years old, and after being raised by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's father for a few years, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was put under the care of an uncle, the Abbé Laurent Jourdan, a parish priest who ran a boarding school in Beaurecueil, in Provence.
[10]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan father died when Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was nine years old, at around 1771, leaving Jean-Baptiste Jourdan as an impoverished orphan.
[11]After finishing Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's basic education at the school in Beaurecueil, at fifteen years old Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was sent to the care of another uncle, Jean-François Jourdan, a cloth merchant in Lyon and disciplinarian employer.
[12]Working as an apprentice clerk at the clothing shop, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan endured for about a year in Lyon before enlisting in the Royal army in 1778, joining the regiment of Auxerrois stationed in the Île de Ré, which was destined for service in the American War of Independence.
[13]



[14]== American Revolutionary War ==
Jean-Baptiste Jourdan spent the rest of the year with the regiment in Île de Ré before it departed for the war in America.
[15]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan first saw action at the capture of Granada in mid-1779.
[16]A few months later the Auxerrois regiment was put under the command of the Comte d'Estaing, and in this assignment Jean-Baptiste Jourdan soon participated in the ill-fated assault at the Siege of Savannah, in October 1779.
[17]Through the next years Jean-Baptiste Jourdan served in the West Indies.
[18]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan took part in the successful defense of the recently captured island of Saint Vincent, in 1780, and in the invasion of Tobago in 1781.During Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's duty in the West Indies, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan fell ill with what was officially diagnosed as hernia, though it was likely an intestinal disease, and bouts of illness troubled Jean-Baptiste Jourdan for the rest of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's military career.
[19]Due to this period of poor health Jean-Baptiste Jourdan missed most of the campaigns of 1782, only returning to the army at the end of the year.


=== Return to Limoges ===
In June 1784, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was demobilized from the Royal army in Verdun, and, after a period of  unemployment, returned to Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's native Limoges and found work at a cloth merchant's shop, where Jean-Baptiste Jourdan proved to be an excellent employee.
[20]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan married Jeanne Nicolas Avanturier, the sister of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's boss, in Limoges on 22 January 1788, and the couple had six children.
[21]

Jean-Baptiste Jourdan welcomed the French Revolution with enthusiasm.
[23]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was appointed lieutenant of the chasseurs of the National Guard in 1790, and when the National Assembly asked for volunteers, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was elected commander of the 9th battalion of volunteers from Haute-Vienne.
[24]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan led Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's troops in the French victory at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792 and in the defeat at the Battle of Neerwinden on 18 March 1793.
[25]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan leadership skills were noticed and led to Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's promotion to Brigade general on 27 May 1793 and to general of division two months later.
[26]On 8 September, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan led Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's division at the Battle of Hondschoote, in which Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was wounded in the chest.
[27]On 22 September, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was named to lead the Army of the North.
[28]Three of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's predecessors, Nicolas Luckner, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, and Jean Nicolas Houchard were under arrest and later executed by guillotine.
[29]

[30]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan first assignment was to relieve General Jacques Ferrand's 20,000-man garrison of Maubeuge which was besieged by an Austrian-Dutch army commanded by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.
[31]The Committee of Public Safety felt that this mission was so important that it dispatched Lazare Carnot to oversee the operation.
[32]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan defeated Coburg on 15–16 October at the Battle of Wattignies and broke the siege.
[33]Carnot claimed that it was his own intervention that won the victory.
[34]Historian Michael Glover writes that the first day's attack was a failure because of Carnot's interference, while the second day's success resulted from Jean-Baptiste Jourdan using Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's own tactical judgment.
[35]In any case, only Carnot's account reached Paris.
[36]On 10 January 1794, after refusing to carry out an impossible order, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was brought before the Committee of Public Safety.
[37]Carnot presented Jean-Baptiste Jourdan arrest warrant, which was signed by Maximilien de Robespierre, Bertrand Barère, and Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois.
[38]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was saved from certain execution when an eyewitness, representative on mission Ernest Joseph Duquesnoy rose and contradicted Carnot's version of events at Wattignies.
[39]Spared from arrest, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was nevertheless dismissed from the army and sent home.
[40]The government soon recalled Jean-Baptiste Jourdan to lead the Army of the Moselle.
[41]In May, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was ordered north with the left wing of the Army of the Moselle.
[42]This force was combined with the Army of the Ardennes and the right wing of the Army of the North to form an army which did not officially become the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse until 29 June 1794.
[43]With 70,000 soldiers of the new army, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan laid siege to Charleroi on 12 June.
[44]A 41,000-man Austrian-Dutch army under the Prince of Orange defeated the French at the Battle of Lambusart on 16 June and drove them south of the Sambre River.
[45]Casualties numbered 3,000 for each army.
[46]Undeterred, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan immediately marched on Namur to the east-northeast of Charleroi.
[47]Instead of attacking Namur, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan suddenly swung west and appeared to the north of Charleroi.
[48]After a brief siege, the 3,000-man Austrian garrison of Charleroi surrendered on 25 June.
[49]Military strategist B. H. Liddell Hart cited Jean-Baptiste Jourdan maneuver as an example of the indirect approach, even though it was probably inadvertent on Jean-Baptiste Jourdan part.
[50]Too late to save Charlerloi, Coburg's 46,000-strong army attacked Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 75,000 French on 26 June.
[51]The Battle of Fleurus proved to be a strategic French victory when Coburg called off his attacks and retreated.
[52]During the battle, the Allied attacks pushed back both French flanks, but Jean-Baptiste Jourdan stubbornly fought it out and was saved when General François Joseph Lefebvre's division held its ground in the center.
[53]

[54]After Fleurus, the Allied position in the Austrian Netherlands collapsed.
[55]The Austrian Army evacuated Belgium and the Dutch Republic was dissolved by the advancing French armies in 1795.
[56]On 7 June 1795, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan army concluded the long but successful Siege of Luxembourg.
[57]Operations east of the Rhine were less successful that year, with the French capturing, then losing Mannheim.
[58]In the Rhine campaign of 1796, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan Army of Sambre-et-Meuse formed the left wing of the advance into Bavaria.
[59]The whole of the French forces were ordered to advance on Vienna, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan on the extreme left, General Jean Victor Marie Moreau in the centre by the Danube valley, and Napoleon on the right in Italy.
[60]The campaign began brilliantly, with the Austrians under Archduke Charles being driven back by Moreau and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan almost to the Austrian frontier.
[61]But Charles, slipping away from Moreau, threw his whole weight on Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 
[62]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan failed to salvage the situation at the Battle of Würzburg and was forced over the Rhine after the Battle of Limburg, which cost the life of General François Séverin Marceau.
[63]Moreau had to fall back in turn, and the operations of the year in Germany were a failure.
[64]The chief cause of defeat was the plan of campaign imposed upon the generals by their government.
[65]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was nevertheless made the scapegoat and was not employed for two years.
[66]In those years Jean-Baptiste Jourdan became prominent as a politician and above all as the framer of the famous conscription law of 1798, which came to be known as the Jourdan law.
[67]



[68]== War of the Second Coalition ==

When war was renewed in 1799, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was at the head of the army on the Rhine, but again suffered defeat at the hands of Archduke Charles at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach in late March.
[69]Disappointed and broken in health, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan handed over command to General André Masséna.
[70]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan resumed Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's political duties and was a prominent opponent of the Coup of 18 Brumaire, after which Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was expelled from the Council of Five Hundred.
[71]Soon, however, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan became formally reconciled to the new régime, and accepted from Napoleon fresh military and civil employment.
[72]In 1800, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan became inspector-general of cavalry and infantry and representative of French interests in the Cisalpine Republic.
[73]



[74]== Napoleonic Wars ==
In 1804, Napoleon appointed Jean-Baptiste Jourdan as a Marshal of the Empire.
[75]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan remained in the newly created Kingdom of Italy until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte, whom his brother made King of Naples that year, selected Jean-Baptiste Jourdan as his military adviser.
[76]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan followed Joseph into Spain in 1808; but Joseph's throne had to be maintained by the French Army, and throughout the Peninsular War, the other marshals, who depended directly upon Napoleon, paid little heed either to Joseph or to Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 
[77]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was blamed for the defeat at the Battle of Talavera in 1809 and replaced by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult.
[78]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was reinstated as Joseph's chief of staff in September 1811 but given few troops.
[79]After the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, Joseph and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan were forced to abandon Madrid and retreat to Valencia.
[80]Joining with Soult's army, which evacuated Andalusia, the French were able to recapture Madrid during the Siege of Burgos and push Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese army back to Portugal.
[81]The following year, Wellington advanced again with a large, well-organized army.
[82]Repeatedly outmaneuvering the French, the Anglo-Allied army forced Joseph and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan to fight at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813, during which Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's marshal's baton was captured by the British.
[83]After the French decisive defeat, which resulted in the permanent loss of Spain, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan held no important commands up to the fall of the French Empire.
[84]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan adhered to the first Bourbon Restoration, in 1814, but joined Napoleon on his return to power during the Hundred Days and was appointed commander of Besançon.
[85]



[86]== Later life ==
Jean-Baptiste Jourdan submitted to the Bourbons again after the final French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.
[87]Afterwards Jean-Baptiste Jourdan refused to be a member of the court which sentenced Marshal Michel Ney to death.
[88]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was made a count (comte de l’Empire) in 1804, a Peer of France in 1819, and governor of Grenoble in 1816.
[89]In politics, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was a prominent opponent of the royalist reactionaries and supported the Revolution of 1830.
[90]After this event, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan held the portfolio of foreign affairs for a few days and then became governor of the Hôtel des Invalides, a post Jean-Baptiste Jourdan held until Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's death.
[91]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan died in Paris on 23 November 1833 and was buried in Les Invalides.
[92]
While in exile on Saint Helena, Napoleon admitted, I certainly used Jean-Baptiste Jourdan very ill ...
[93]I have learned with pleasure that since my fall Jean-Baptiste Jourdan invariably acted in the best manner.
[94]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan has thus afforded an example of that praiseworthy elevation of mind which distinguishes men one from another.
[95]Jean-Baptiste Jourdan is a true patriot; and that is the answer to many things that have been said of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan 
[96]
Jean-Baptiste Jourdan wrote Opérations de l'armée du Danube ("Operations of the Army of the Danube", 1799), Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire sur la campagne de 1796 ("Memoirs to serve history of the campaign of 1796", 1819), and unpublished personal memoirs.
