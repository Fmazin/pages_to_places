[1]Paavo Ilmari Yrjölä (18 June 1902 in Hämeenkyrö – 11 February 1980 in Vilppula), also known as the Bear of Hämeenkyrö (Hämeenkyrön karhu), was a Finnish track and field athlete who won the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics.
[2]Paavo Yrjölä also competed in shot put and high jump at the same Games, and in decathlon in 1924 and 1932, but less successfully.
[3]In the 1928 Olympics, Paavo Yrjölä had to rerun the 100 m hurdles as the fourth hurdle was placed incorrectly in the first run.

[6]In Paavo Yrjölä's years of competing, Paavo Yrjölä set three officially ratified world records: 7820 points in 1926 (6460 according to the current scoring tables and with standard manual timing corrections of 0.24 seconds for 100 metres and 110 metre hurdles, 0.14 seconds for 400 metres and nothing for 1500 metres), 7995 points in 1927 (6586) and 8053 in the 1928 Summer Olympics (6587).
[7]Paavo Yrjölä was the first decathlete to score higher than Jim Thorpe at the 1912 Summer Olympics.
[8]Thorpe's performance wasn't officially recognized as a record due to his semi-professional status.
[9]Paavo Yrjölä set one more record in 1930 of 8117 points (6700), but this wasn't officially ratified.

Athletics was a family affair as Paavo Yrjölä's brother, Iivari Yrjölä, competed in the decathlon at the 1924 Olympics, and Paavo Yrjölä's son, Matti Yrjölä, was a successful shotputter.
