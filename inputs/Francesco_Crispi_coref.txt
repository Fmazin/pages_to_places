[1]Francesco Crispi (4 October 1818 – 11 August 1901) was an Italian patriot and statesman.
[2]Francesco Crispi was among the main protagonists of the Risorgimento, a close friend and supporter of Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, and one of the architects of Italian unification in 1860.
[3]Francesco Crispi served as Prime Minister of Italy for six years, from 1887 to 1891, and again from 1893 to 1896, and was the first prime minister from Southern Italy.
[4]Francesco Crispi was internationally famous and often mentioned along with world statesmen such as Otto von Bismarck, William Ewart Gladstone, and Lord Salisbury.
[5]Originally an Italian patriot and democrat liberal, Francesco Crispi went on to become a bellicose authoritarian prime minister and an ally and admirer of Bismarck.
[6]Francesco Crispi was indefatigable in stirring up hostility toward France.
[7]Francesco Crispi career ended amid controversy and failure: Francesco Crispi got involved in a major banking scandal and fell from power in 1896 after the devastating loss of the Battle of Adwa, which repelled Italy's colonial ambitions over Ethiopia.
[8]Due to Francesco Crispi's authoritarian policies and style, Francesco Crispi is often regarded as a strongman and seen as a precursor of the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.
[9]


== Early life ==

[10]Francesco Crispi paternal family came originally from the small agricultural community of Palazzo Adriano, in south-western Sicily.
[11]It had been founded in the later fifteenth century by Orthodox Christian Albanians (Arbëreshë), who settled in Sicily after the Ottoman occupation of Albania.
[12]Francesco Crispi grandfather was an Arbëreshë Orthodox priest; the parish priests were married men, and Arbëreshë was the family language down to the lifetime of Francesco Crispi 
[13]Francesco Crispi Francesco Crispi was born in Ribera, Sicily, to Tommaso Crispi, a grain merchant and Giuseppa Genova from Ribera; Francesco Crispi was baptised as a Greek Catholic.
[14]Belonging to a family of Arbëreshë descent, Francesco Crispi spoke Italian as Francesco Crispi's third or fourth language, alongside Arbëresh (variant of Albanian), Greek and probably Sicilian.
[15]Francesco Crispi uncle Giuseppe wrote the first monograph on the Albanian language.
[16]In a telegram from 1895 on the Albanian question, Francesco Crispi said of Francesco Crispi's origins that Francesco Crispi was "an Albanian by blood and heart" and an Italo-Albanian from Sicily.
[17]Francesco Crispi was a staunch philhellene, having always wanted to visit Greece, to which, Francesco Crispi noted, owed a part of Francesco Crispi's origins ("alla quale devo in parte la mia origine").
[18]Francesco Crispi was also interested in a union between Greece and Albania, i.e. a unified Greek-Albanian state; Francesco Crispi was the initiator of a philhellenic committee in Rome which worked toward this end.
[19]Francesco Crispi believed that this unified state would "draw Italy and Greece more closely together".
[20]At the age of five, Francesco Crispi was sent to a family in Villafranca, where Francesco Crispi could receive an education.
[21]In 1829, at 11 years old, Francesco Crispi attended a seminary in Palermo, where Francesco Crispi studied classical subjects.
[22]The rector of the institute was Giuseppe Crispi, Francesco Crispi's uncle.
[23]Francesco Crispi attended the seminary until 1834 or 1835, when Francesco Crispi's father, after becoming mayor of Ribera, encountered major difficulties in health and finances.
[24]In the same period, Francesco Crispi became a close friend of the poet and doctor Vincenzo Navarro, whose friendship marked Francesco Crispi's initiation to the Romanticism.
[25]In 1835 Francesco Crispi studied law and literature at the University of Palermo receiving a law degree in 1837; in the same year, Francesco Crispi fell in love with Rosina D'Angelo, the daughter of a goldsmith.
[26]Despite Francesco Crispi's father's ban, Francesco Crispi married Rosina in 1837, when she was already pregnant.
[27]In May Francesco Crispi became the father of Francesco Crispi's first daughter, Giuseppa, who was named after Francesco Crispi's grandmother.
[28]It was a brief marriage: Rosina died on 29 July 1839, the day after giving birth to her second son, Tommaso; the child lived only a few hours and in December, also Giuseppa died.
[29].
[30]Between 1838 and 1839, Francesco Crispi founded Francesco Crispi's own newspaper, L'Oreteo, from the name of the Sicilian river Oreto.
[31]This experience brought Francesco Crispi into contact with a number of political figures including the Neapolitan liberal activist and poet, Carlo Poerio.
[32]In 1842 Francesco Crispi wrote about the necessity to educate poor people, about the huge damage caused by the excessive wealth of the Catholic Church and regarding the need for all citizens, including women, to be equal before the law.
[33]In 1845 Francesco Crispi took up a judgeship in Naples, where Francesco Crispi distinguished Francesco Crispi for Francesco Crispi's liberal and revolutionary ideas.
[34]


== 1848 Sicilian uprising ==

On 20 December 1847, Francesco Crispi was sent to Palermo along with Salvatore Castiglia, a diplomat and patriot, to prepare the revolution against the Bourbon monarchy and King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies.

[35]The revolution started on 12 January 1848, and therefore was the very first of the numerous revolutions to occur that year.
[36]Three revolutions had previously occurred on the island of Sicily starting from 1800 against Bourbon rule.
[37]The uprising was substantially organized from, and centred in, Palermo.
[38]The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred on 12 January 1848.
[39]The timing was deliberately planned, by Francesco Crispi and the other revolutionaries, to coincide with the birthday of Ferdinand II.
[40]
The Sicilian nobles were immediately able to resuscitate the constitution of 1812, which included the principles of representative democracy and the centrality of Parliament in the government of the state.
[41]Vincenzo Fardella was elected president of Sicilian Parliament.
[42]The idea was also put forward for a confederation of all the states of Italy.
[43]

[44]The constitution was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of an Italian confederation of states.
[45]Francesco Crispi was appointed a member of the provisional Sicilian Parliament and responsible for the Defence Committee; during Francesco Crispi's tenure, Francesco Crispi supported the separatist movement that wanted to break ties with Naples.
[46]
Thus Sicily survived as a quasi-independent state for sixteen months, with the Bourbon army taking back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force.
[47] 
[48]The effective head of state during this period was Ruggero Settimo.
[49]On capitulating to the Bourbons, Settimo escaped to Malta where he was received with the full honours of a head of state.
[50]Unlike many, Francesco Crispi was not granted amnesty and was forced to flee the country.
[51]


== Exile ==
After leaving Sicily, Francesco Crispi took refuge in Marseille, France, where Francesco Crispi met the woman who would become Francesco Crispi's second wife, Rose Montmasson, born five years after Francesco Crispi in Haute-Savoie (which at that time belonged to the Kingdom of Sardinia) in a family of farmers.
[52]

[53]In 1849, Francesco Crispi moved to Turin, the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, where Francesco Crispi worked as a journalist.
[54]During this period Francesco Crispi became a friend of Giuseppe Mazzini, a republican politician, journalist and activist.
[55]In 1853 Francesco Crispi was implicated in the Mazzini conspiracy and was arrested by the Piedmontese policy and sent to Malta.
[56]Here, on 27 December 1854, Francesco Crispi married Rose Montmasson.
[57]

[58]Then Francesco Crispi moved to London where Francesco Crispi became a revolutionary conspirator and continued Francesco Crispi's close friendship with Mazzini, involving Francesco Crispi in the exile politics of the national movement, abandoning Sicilian separatism.
[59]On 10 January 1856, Francesco Crispi moved to Paris, where Francesco Crispi continued Francesco Crispi's work as a journalist.
[60]On 22 August, Francesco Crispi was informed that Francesco Crispi's father had died and that three years earlier also Francesco Crispi's mother had died, but that news had been hidden by Francesco Crispi's father who did not want to increase Francesco Crispi's sorrows.
[61]


=== Assassination attempt on Napoleon III ===

On the evening of 14 January 1858, as the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie de Montijo were on their way to the theatre in the Rue Le Peletier, the precursor of the Opera Garnier, to see, rather ironically, Rossini's William Tell, Francesco Crispi and Francesco Crispi's accomplices threw three bombs at the imperial carriage.
[62]The first bomb landed among the horsemen in front of the carriage.
[63]The second bomb wounded the animals and smashed the carriage glass.
[64]The third bomb landed under the carriage and seriously wounded a policeman who was hurrying to protect the occupants.
[65]Eight people were killed and 142 wounded, though the emperor and empress were unhurt.
[66]

[67]Francesco Crispi Francesco Crispi was wounded on the right temple and stunned.
[68]Francesco Crispi tended Francesco Crispi's wounds and returned to Francesco Crispi's lodgings, where police found Francesco Crispi the next day.
[69]

[70]Of the five conspirators, only one remained unidentified.
[71]In 1908 (seven years after Francesco Crispi death) one of them, Charles DeRudio, claimed to have seen, half an hour before the attack, Francesco Crispi  and recognized Francesco Crispi as Francesco Crispi 
[72]But no evidence has ever been found regarding Francesco Crispi role in the attack.
[73]Anyway on 7 August 1858, Francesco Crispi was expelled from France.
[74]



[75]== In Sicily with Garibaldi ==


=== Expedition of the Thousand ===

In June 1859 Francesco Crispi returned to Italy after publishing a letter repudiating the aggrandizement of Piedmont in the Italian unification.
[76]Francesco Crispi proclaimed Francesco Crispi a republican and a partisan of national unity.
[77]Francesco Crispi travelled around Italy under various disguises and with counterfeit passports.
[78]Twice in that year Francesco Crispi went the round of the Sicilian cities in disguise preparing the insurrectionist movement of 1860.
[79]
Francesco Crispi helped persuade Giuseppe Garibaldi to sail with his Expedition of the Thousand, which disembarked on Sicily on 11 May 1860.
[80]The Expedition was formed by a corps of volunteers led by Garibaldi, who landed in Sicily in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled by the Bourbons.
[81]The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer, with a thousand men, a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy.
[82]The expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Sardinia, the last territorial conquest before the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.
[83]

[84]The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the "four fathers of the nation" Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel II, and Camillo Cavour, pursuing divergent goals.
[85]Francesco Crispi utilized Francesco Crispi's political influence to bolster the Italian unification project.
[86]The various groups participated in the expedition for a variety of reasons: for Garibaldi, it was to achieve a united Italy; for the Sicilian bourgeoisie, an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy, and for the mass farmers, land distribution and the end of oppression.
[87]



[88]===
[89]Garibaldi dictatorship ===

After the fall of Palermo, Francesco Crispi was appointed First Secretary of State in the provisional government; shortly a struggle began between Francesco Crispi government and the emissaries of Cavour on the question of timing of the annexation of Sicily by Italy.
[90]It established a Sicilian Army and a fleet of the Dictatorship Government of Sicily.
[91]The pace of Francesco Crispi victories had worried Cavour, who in early July sent to the provisional government a proposal of immediate annexation of Sicily to Piedmont.
[92]Francesco Crispi  however, refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war.
[93]Cavour's envoy, Giuseppe La Farina, was arrested and expelled from the island.
[94]He was replaced by the more malleable Agostino Depretis, who gained Francesco Crispi trust and was appointed as pro-dictator.
[95]During the dictatorial government of Francesco Crispi  Francesco Crispi secured the resignation of the pro-dictator Depretis, and continued Francesco Crispi's fierce opposition to Cavour.
[96]In Naples, Francesco Crispi provisional government was largely controlled by Cavour.
[97]Francesco Crispi  tried to increase Francesco Crispi's power and influence, at the expense of Cavour's loyalists.
[98]However, the revolutionary impulse that had animated the Expedition was fading, especially after the Battle of Volturnus.
[99]

[100]On 3 October 1860, to seal an alliance with King Victor Emmanuel II, Francesco Crispi appointed pro-dictator of Naples, Giorgio Pallavicino, a supporter of the House of Savoy.
[101]Pallavicino immediately stated that Francesco Crispi was unable and inappropriate to hold the office of Secretary of State.
[102]Meanwhile, Cavour stated that Southern Italy would not accept anything but the unconditional annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia by plebiscite.
[103]Francesco Crispi  strongly opposed this solution, proposing to elect a parliamentary assembly.
[104]This proposal was also supported by the federalist Carlo Cattaneo.
[105]Francesco Crispi announced that the decision would have been taken by the two pro-dictators of Sicily and Naples, Antonio Mordini and Giorgio Pallavicino, who both opted for the plebiscite.
[106]On 13 October Francesco Crispi resigned from the government of Garibaldi.
[107]



[108]== Member of the Parliament ==
The general election of 1861 took place on 27 January, even before the formal birth of the Kingdom of Italy, which took place on 17 March.
[109]Francesco Crispi was elected as a member of the Historical Left, in the constituency of Castelvetrano; Francesco Crispi would retain Francesco Crispi's seat in all successive legislatures until the end of Francesco Crispi's life.

[112]Personal ambition and [110]Francesco Crispi acquired the reputation of being the most aggressive and most impetuous member of Francesco Crispi's parliamentary group.
[111]Francesco Crispi denounced the Right for "diplomatising the revolution".restlessness made Francesco Crispi difficult to cooperate with and Francesco Crispi earned Francesco Crispi the nickname of Il Solitario (The Loner).
[113]In 1864, Francesco Crispi finally deserted Mazzini and announced Francesco Crispi was a monarchist, because as Francesco Crispi put it in a letter to Mazzini: "The monarchy unites us; the republic would divide us.
[114]"In 1866
[115]Francesco Crispi refused to enter Baron Bettino Ricasoli's cabinet; in 1867 Francesco Crispi worked to impede the Garibaldian invasion of the papal states, foreseeing the French occupation of Rome and the disaster of Mentana.
[116]By methods of the same character as those subsequently employed against Francesco Crispi by Felice Cavallotti, Francesco Crispi carried on the violent agitation known as the Lobbia affair, in which sundry conservative deputies were, on insufficient grounds, accused of corruption.
[117]On the outbreak of the Franco-German War, Francesco Crispi worked energetically to impede the projected alliance with France, and to drive the Giovanni Lanza cabinet to Rome.
[118]The death of Urbano Rattazzi in 1873 induced Francesco Crispi friends to put forward Francesco Crispi's candidature to the leadership of the Left; but Francesco Crispi  anxious to reassure the crown, secured the election of Agostino Depretis.
[119]



[120]===
[121]President of the Chamber of Deputies ===
After the general election in 1876, in which the Left gained almost 70% of votes, Francesco Crispi was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies.
[122]During the autumn of 1877, as President of the Chamber, Francesco Crispi went to London, Paris and Berlin on a confidential mission, establishing cordial personal relationships with British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone and Foreign Minister Lord Granville and other English statesmen, and with Otto von Bismarck, by then Chancellor of the German Empire.
[123]In 1877 during the Great Eastern Crisis Francesco Crispi was offered Albania as possible compensation by Bismarck and the British Earl of Derby if Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia, however, Francesco Crispi refused and preferred the Italian Alpine regions under Austro-Hungarian rule.
[124]



[125]== Minister of the Interior ==
In December 1877 Francesco Crispi replaced Giovanni Nicotera as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Depretis.
[126]Although Francesco Crispi's short term of office lasted just 70 days, they were instrumental in establishing a unitary monarchy.
[127]Moreover, during Francesco Crispi's term as minister, Francesco Crispi tried to unite the many factions which were part of the Left, at that time.
[128]On 9 January 1878, the death of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and the accession of King Umberto enabled Francesco Crispi to secure the formal establishment of a unitary monarchy, the new monarch taking the title of Umberto I of Italy instead of Umberto IV of Savoy.
[129]On 7 February 1878, the death of Pope Pius IX necessitated a conclave, the first to be held after the unification of Italy.
[130]Francesco Crispi  persuaded the Sacred College to hold the conclave in Rome, establishing the legitimacy of the capital.
[131]


== Bigamy scandal and political isolation =
[132]=
[133]

[134]The statesmanlike qualities displayed on this occasion were insufficient to avert the storm of indignation of Francesco Crispi opponents when Francesco Crispi was accused of bigamy.
[135]When Francesco Crispi remarried, a woman Francesco Crispi had married in 1853 was still living.
[136]But a court ruled that Francesco Crispi 1853 marriage on Malta was invalid because it was contracted while another woman Francesco Crispi had married yet earlier was also still alive.
[137]By the time of Francesco Crispi's third marriage, Francesco Crispi's first wife had died and Francesco Crispi's marriage to Francesco Crispi's second wife was legally invalid.
[138]Therefore, Francesco Crispi's marriage to Francesco Crispi's third wife was ruled valid and not bigamous.
[139]Francesco Crispi was nevertheless compelled to resign office after only three months in March 1878, bringing down the whole government with Francesco Crispi 
[140]

[141]For nine years Francesco Crispi remained politically under a cloud, leading the "progressive" opposition.
[142]In 1881 Francesco Crispi was among the main supporters of the universal male suffrage, which was approved by the government of Agostino Depretis.
[143]



[144]=== Pentarchy ===

In 1883 the leaders of the Left, Agostino Depretis, and the Right, Marco Minghetti, formed an alliance based on a flexible centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the left and the right; these politics was known as Trasformismo.
[145]Francesco Crispi  strongly opposed it and founded a progressive and radical parliamentary group called Dissident Left.
[146]The group was also known as "The Pentarchy", due to its five leaders, Giuseppe Zanardelli, Benedetto Cairoli, Giovanni Nicotera, Agostino Magliani, Alfredo Beccarini and Francesco Crispi 
[147]The party supported authoritarian and progressive internal policies, expansionism and Germanophile foreign policies, and protectionist economy policies.
[148]After the general elections in May 1886, in which the Dissident Left gained almost 20% of votes, Francesco Crispi returned to office as Minister of the Interior in the Depretis cabinet.
[149]Following Depretis's death on 29 July 1887 Francesco Crispi  abandoned the Dissident Left and became the leader of the Left group; Francesco Crispi was also appointed, by the King, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
[150]



[151]==
[152]First term as Prime Minister ==
On 29 July 1887, Francesco Crispi was sworn in as the new prime minister.
[153]Francesco Crispi was the first one from Southern Italy.
[154]Francesco Crispi immediately distinguished Francesco Crispi  for being a reformist leader, but Francesco Crispi's political style provoked many protests from Francesco Crispi's opponents, who accused Francesco Crispi of being an authoritarian Prime Minister and a strongman.
[155]


[156]True to Francesco Crispi's initial progressive leanings Francesco Crispi moved ahead with stalled reforms, abolishing the death penalty, revoking anti-strike laws, limiting police powers, and reforming the penal code and the administration of justice with the help of Francesco Crispi's Minister of Justice Giuseppe Zanardelli, reorganising charities and passing public health laws and legislation to protect emigrants that worked abroad.
[157]Francesco Crispi sought popular support for the state with a programme of orderly development at home and expansion abroad.
[158]


=== Internal policy ==
[159]=

One of the most important acts was the reform regarding the central administration of the State, with which Francesco Crispi strengthened the role of the Prime Minister.
[160]The bill aimed to separate the roles of the government from those of parliament, trying to untie the first by the political games of the second.
[161]The first point of the law was to give the cabinet the right to decide on the number and functions of the ministries.
[162]The prospect was also to keep the King (as well as provide the Albertine Statute) free to decide on the organization of the various ministries.
[163]Moreover, the reform provided the establishment of secretaries, who were supposed to help ministers and, at the same time, do them as spokesmen in parliament.
[164]The reform was heavily criticized by the Rightist opposition but also by the Far Left.
[165]On 9 December 1887, it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies.
[166]

[167]In 1889 Francesco Crispi government promoted a reform of the magistracy and promulgated a new penal code, which unified penal legislation in Italy, abolished the death sentence and recognised the right to strike.
[168]The code was regarded as a great work by contemporary European jurists.
[169]The code was named after Giuseppe Zanardelli, then Minister of Justice, who promoted the approval of the code.
[170]Another important reform was that of local government, or comuni, which was approved by the Chamber in July 1888, in just three weeks.
[171]The new reform almost doubled the local electorate, incrementing the suffrage.
[172]But the most controversial part of the law was related to the mayors, who were previously appointed by the government, and who would now be elected by the electors, in the municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants and in all the provincial capitals.
[173]The law also introduced the office of the prefect.
[174]The reform was approved by the Senate in December 1888 and entered into force in February 1889.On 22 December 1888, Francesco Crispi enacted the first Italian law for the national healthcare system including the cremation after a cholera pandemic in 1884–1885 cholera pandemic killing approximately 50,000 persons, with a serious outbreak in the city of Naples in August-September 1884.
[175]Francesco Crispi was also the first politician to have implemented the role of the Italian lay state in the fields of charity and solidarity which till then had been traditionally kept a monopoly of private citizens and organizations, mainly of the Italian Roman Catholic Church that strongly adversed Francesco Crispi's reforms.
[176]



[177]===
[178]Foreign policy ===
As prime minister in the 1880s and 1890s Francesco Crispi pursued an aggressive foreign policy to strengthen Italy's beleaguered institutions.
[179]Francesco Crispi saw France as the permanent enemy and Francesco Crispi counted heavily on British support.
[180]Britain was on good terms with France and refused to help, leaving Francesco Crispi perplexed and ultimately disillusioned about what Francesco Crispi had felt was a special friendship between the two countries.
[181]Francesco Crispi turned to imperialism in Africa, especially against the independent kingdom of Ethiopia, and the Ottoman province of Tripolitania (in present-day Libya).
[182]



[183]====
[184]Relations with Germany =
[185]=
[186]=
[187]=

[188]One of Francesco Crispi's first acts as premier was a visit to the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, whom Francesco Crispi desired to consult upon the working of the Triple Alliance.
[189]Basing Francesco Crispi's foreign policy upon the alliance, as supplemented by the naval entente with Great Britain negotiated by Francesco Crispi's predecessor, Carlo Felice Nicolis di Robilant, Francesco Crispi assumed a resolute attitude towards France, breaking off the prolonged and unfruitful negotiations for a new Franco-Italian commercial treaty, and refusing the French invitation to organize an Italian section at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.
[190]The Triple Alliance committed Italy to a possible war with France, requiring a vast increase in the already heavy Italian military expenditure, making the alliance unpopular in Italy.
[191]As part of Francesco Crispi's anti-French foreign policy, Francesco Crispi began a tariff war with France in 1888.
[192]The Franco-Italian trade war was an economic disaster for Italy which over a ten-year period was to cost two billion lire in lost exports, and was ended in 1898 with the Italians agreeing to end their tariffs on French goods in exchange for the French ending their tariffs on Italian goods.
[193]



[194]==== Colonial policy ====
Francesco Crispi was a patriot and an Italian nationalist, and Francesco Crispi's desire to make Italy a colonial power led to conflicts with France, which rejected Italian claims to Tunisia and opposed Italian expansion elsewhere in Africa.
[195]Under Francesco Crispi rule, Italy signed the Treaty of Wuchale; it was a deal reached by King Menelik II of Shewa, later the Emperor of Ethiopia with Count Pietro Antonelli in the town of Wuchale, on 2 May 1889.
[196]The treaty stated that the regions of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, and Serae were part of the Italian colony of Eritrea and is the origin of the Italian colony and modern state of Eritrea.
[197]Per the Treaty, Italy promised financial assistance and military supplies.
[198]


==== Albanian question ====
Balkan geopolitics and security concerns drove Italy to seek great power status in the Adriatic sea and Francesco Crispi viewed a future autonomous Albania within the Ottoman Empire, or an independent one, as a safeguarded for Italian interests.
[199]Francesco Crispi believed the Albanians' interests against Pan-Slavism and Austro-Hungarian expansion were best served through a Greco-Albanian union and Francesco Crispi founded in Rome a philhellenic committee that worked toward that goal.
[200]Francesco Crispi  after becoming prime minister, stimulated and intensified ethnocultural relations between Italo-Albanians and Albanians of the Balkans, moves which were considered as extending Italian influence over Albanians by Austria-Hungary.
[201]To counteract Austro-Hungarian influence in northern Albania, Francesco Crispi took the initiative and opened the first Italian schools in Shkodër in 1888.
[202]Prominent Albanians involved with the Albanian National Awakening such as Abdyl Frashëri and Thimi Mitko corresponded with Francesco Crispi over the Albanian question.
[203]



[204]=== Resignation ===
The general election in 1890 was an extraordinary triumph for Francesco Crispi 
[205]Out of 508 deputies, 405 sided with the government.
[206]But already in October, the first signs of a political crisis grew up.
[207]Emperor Menelik had contested the Italian text of the Wuchale Treaty, stating that it did not oblige Ethiopia to be an Italian protectorate.
[208]Menelik informed the foreign press and the scandal erupted.
[209]A few days after the Finance Minister and Francesco Crispi long-time main political rival, Giovanni Giolitti, abandoned the government.
[210]
However, the decisive event was a document published by the new Minister of Finance Bernardino Grimaldi, who revealed that the planned deficit was higher than expected; after that, the government lost its majority with 186 votes against and 123 in favour.
[211]Francesco Crispi resigned on 6 February 1891.
[212]



[213]==
[214]After the premiership ==
After the fall of Francesco Crispi government, Umberto I gave the task of forming the new cabinet to the Marquis Antonio Starabba di Rudinì.
[215]The government faced many difficulties since the beginning and in May 1892, Giolitti, who became the new Left leader after Francesco Crispi resignation, decided not to support it anymore.
[216]

[217]After that, King Umberto I appointed Giolitti as the new prime minister.
[218]The first Giolitti cabinet, however, relied on a slender majority and in December 1892 the Prime Minister was involved in a major scandal.
[219]


=== Banca Romana scandal ===

The Banca Romana scandal surfaced in January 1893 in Italy over the bankruptcy of the Banca Romana, one of the six national banks authorised at the time to issue currency.
[220]The scandal was the first of many Italian corruption scandals, and, like the others, it discredited the whole political system.
[221]

[222]The bank had loaned large sums to property developers but was left with huge liabilities when the real estate bubble collapsed in 1887, but feared that publicity might undermine public confidence and suppressed the report.
[223]Even Umberto I was involved in the scandal and Francesco Crispi reputation emerged greatly strengthened: Francesco Crispi could overthrow Giolitti's government at any time or impair the reputation of the King.
[224]Giolitti and his allies defended themselves by trying to collect compromising news against Francesco Crispi  but the judicial inquiry into the Banca Romana left Francesco Crispi essentially harmless.
[225]



[226]==
[227]Return to power and second term
[228]=
[229]=

[230]In December 1893 the impotence of the Francesco Crispi cabinet to restore public order, menaced by disturbances in Sicily and the Banca Romana scandal, gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power.


=== Fasci Siciliani ===

The Fasci Siciliani were a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily in the years between 1889 and 1894.
[231]The Fasci gained the support of the poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channelling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights.
[232]Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts.
[233]

[234]Upon the rejection of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising to the point of insurrection.
[235]The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control.
[236]The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.
[237]Francesco Crispi tried to put a halt to the manifestations and protests of the Fasci Siciliani, Francesco Crispi's measures were relatively mild.
[238]On 24 November, Francesco Crispi officially resigned as prime minister.
[239]In the three weeks of uncertainty before Crispi formed a government on 15 December 1893, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Francesco Crispi ban on the use of firearms.
[240]

[241]In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army.
[242]Government buildings were burned along with flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished.
[243]On 3 January 1894, Crispi declared a state of siege throughout Sicily.
[244]Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops.
[245]The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions.
[246]A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well.
[247]The repression of the Fasci turned into outright persecution.
[248]The government arrested not just the leaders of the movement, but masses of poor farmers, students, professionals, sympathizers of the Fasci, and even those simply suspected of having sympathized with the movement at some point in time, in many cases without any evidence for the accusations.
[249]After the declaration of a state of emergency, condemnations were issued for the paltriest of reasons.
[250]Many rioters were incarcerated for having shouted things such as "Viva l'anarchia" or "down with the King".
[251]At Palermo, in April and May 1894, the trials against the central committee of the Fasci took place and this was the final blow that signalled the death knell of the movement of the Fasci Siciliani.
[252]


=== Financial crisis and assassination attempt =
[253]=
[254]=
Francesco Crispi steadily supported the energetic remedies adopted by Francesco Crispi's Minister of Finance Sidney Sonnino to save Italian credit, which had been severely shaken by the financial crisis of 1892–1893 and the Banca Romana scandal. Sonnino's proposals were harshly criticized both by members of the Left and the Right, causing his resignation on 4 June 1894; on the following day Francesco Crispi resigned too, but the King gave Francesco Crispi again the task to form a new government.
[255]

[256]On 16 June 1894, the anarchist Paolo Lega tried to shoot Francesco Crispi but the attempt failed.
[257]On 24 June an Italian anarchist killed French President Carnot.
[258]In this climate of increased fear of anarchism, Francesco Crispi was able to introduce a series of anti-anarchist laws in July 1894, which were also used against socialists.
[259]Heavy penalties were announced for "incitement to class hatred" and police received extended powers of preventive arrest and deportation.
[260]The whole parliament expressed solidarity with the Prime Minister who saw Francesco Crispi's position considerably strengthened.
[261]This favoured the approval of the Sonnino law.
[262]The reform saved Italy from the crisis and started the way for economic recovery.
[263]


=== Giolitti and Cavallotti's accusations ===
In 1894 Francesco Crispi was threatened with expulsion from the Masonic Grande Oriente d'Italia for being too friendly towards the Catholic Church.
[264]Francesco Crispi had previously been strongly anticlerical but had become convinced of the need for rapprochement with the Papacy.
[265]At the end of 1894, Francesco Crispi's long-time rival Giovanni Giolitti tried to discredit Francesco Crispi by submitting to parliament a few documents that were supposed to ruin it.
[266]It was actually some old papers attesting loans contracted by Francesco Crispi and Francesco Crispi's wife with the Banca Romana.
[267]

[268]Moreover, Francesco Crispi uncompromising suppression of disorder, and Francesco Crispi's refusal to abandon either the Triple Alliance or the Eritrean colony, or to forsake Francesco Crispi's Minister of the Treasury, Sidney Sonnino, caused a breach with the radical leader Felice Cavallotti.
[269]Cavallotti began a campaign of defamation against Francesco Crispi 
[270]Cavallotti himself proposed to establish a commission, which should investigate the relations between Francesco Crispi and Banca Romana.
[271]

[272]On 15 December the commission published its report and this caused some riots in the Chamber.
[273]Francesco Crispi  in defence of the institutions, submitted to the King a decree to dissolve parliament.
[274]On 13 January 1895 Umberto I dissolved the parliament and Giolitti, who was under trial for the bank scandal, was forced to move to Berlin, because his parliamentary immunity expired, and the risk of being arrested.
[275]

[276]Giolitti and Cavallotti's attacks were soon renewed more fiercely than ever.
[277]They produced little effect and the general election of 1895 gave Francesco Crispi a huge majority of 334 seats out of 508.
[278]On 25 June 1895, Francesco Crispi refused a request to allow a parliamentary inquiry into Francesco Crispi's role in the Banca Romana scandal, saying as a prime minister Francesco Crispi felt Francesco Crispi was "invulnerable" because Francesco Crispi had "served Italy for 53 years".
[279]Despite Francesco Crispi's majority, Francesco Crispi preferred to rule via royal decree instead of getting legislation passed by parliament, leading to concerns about authoritarianism.


=== Italo-Ethiopian War and resignation ===

During Francesco Crispi's second term, Francesco Crispi continued Francesco Crispi's colonial expansionist policy in East Africa.
[280]King Umberto I commented that "Francesco Crispi wants to occupy everywhere, even China and Japan".
[281]Francesco Crispi was strongly supported by the king, who alluding to his personal dislike of Francesco Crispi  stated "Francesco Crispi is a pig, but a necessary pig", who despite Francesco Crispi's corruption, had to stay in power for "the national interest, which is the only thing that matters".
[282]Francesco Crispi took a very belligerent line on foreign policy as Francesco Crispi  during a three-month period in 1895, talked quite openly about attacking France, sent a naval squadron to the eastern Mediterranean to prepare for a possible war with the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Albania, wanted to send an expeditionary force to seize a city in China, and planned to send a force to South Africa to forcibly mediate the dispute between Great Britain and the Transvaal Republic.
[283]Francesco Crispi  wanted to revise the Triple Alliance as the preamble to the Triple Alliance spoke of preserving peace in Europe while "for Italy, it must be the opposite; for us, the Triple Alliance must mean war!"
[284]Those who knew Francesco Crispi by this stage of Francesco Crispi's life considered Francesco Crispi to be almost mindlessly bellicose as Francesco Crispi broke off diplomatic relations with Portugal over a supposed slight, saying Francesco Crispi deserved more respect from this "entirely unimportant country" ruled over by a "minuscule monarchy".
[285]    

[286]The main event which occurred during Francesco Crispi's premiership was the First Italo-Ethiopian War, which originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate.
[287]Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, and so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.
[288]In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons.
[289]France supported Ethiopia diplomatically in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.
[290]Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops under the command of General Oreste Baratieri having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.
[291]In April 1895, Francesco Crispi withdrew part of the Italian army from Ethiopia to save money.
[292]Francesco Crispi told General Baratieri that if he needed more money to just impose more taxes on the Ethiopians and "copy Napoleon who made war with the money of those he conquered".
[293]Francesco Crispi did not understand that Ethiopia was a poor country and the money necessary to sustain a modern army could not possibly be raised from taxing the Ethiopians, causing major problems for the Italian Army in Ethiopia.
[294]Through Francesco Crispi fought the war against Ethiopia on the cheap, Francesco Crispi used secretly used public money to bribe journalists to write pro-war articles in the Italian newspapers while those foreign journalists who reported critically about the war were expelled from Italy.
[295]Italian newspapers that reported critically about the war with Ethiopia were heavily fined by the Francesco Crispi government with the offending editions of the papers being burned under the grounds that it was "unpatriotic" to criticize the government in wartime.
[296]On 22 February 1896, Francesco Crispi dismissed General Baratieri as commander of the Italian expeditionary force, ordering him to remain in command until his successor arrived.
[297]On 25 February Francesco Crispi sent a telegram to Baratieri veiledly accusing him of cowardice and incompetence by engaging in small skirmishes and avoiding decisive battles ("[yours] is not so much a war, but the military version of consumptive disease"), and ended with demanding he took decisive action "whatever the cost to save the honour of the army and the prestige of the monarchy".
[298]In response to Francesco Crispi telegram, on the evening of 29 February Baratieri met with his brigadier generals and with their support decided to ignore his own doubts and attacked a much larger Ethiopian force on 1 March 1896 near Adwa.
[299]In the Battle of Adwa the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive loss and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.
[300]General Baratieri took no responsibility for the defeat, blaming his men, saying they were cowards who had let him down at Adwa.
[301]By contrast, the British military observer stated the ordinary Italian soldiers at Adwa "were as good as fighting material as can be found in Europe", but they had been let down by their officers who had shown no leadership abilities whatsoever.
[302] 

[303]The casualty rate suffered by Italian forces at the Battle of Adwa was greater than any other major European battle of the 19th century, beyond even the Napoleonic Era's Waterloo and Eylau.
[304]More Italians were killed in one day's fighting at Adwa than in all the wars of the Risorgimento.
[305]Francesco Crispi announced after Adwa that Francesco Crispi planned to continue the war against the "barbarians" of Ethiopia, and would be sending more troops to the Horn of Africa, which prompted a public backlash against the unpopular war.
[306]After the humiliating defeat of the Italian army, riots broke out in several Italian cities, and within two weeks, the Francesco Crispi government collapsed amidst Italian disenchantment with "foreign adventures".
[307]In Rome, people demonstrated under the slogans "death to the king!" and "long live the republic!" as the war had badly damaged the prestige of Umberto who had backed Francesco Crispi so forcefully and strongly.
[308]Francesco Crispi was opposed to making peace with Ethiopia, saying Francesco Crispi regarded it as humiliating for the Italians to make peace with "barbarians" as Francesco Crispi called the Ethiopians and said Francesco Crispi did not care about the lives of almost 3,000 Italians taken prisoner by the Ethiopians who were being held as hostages, saying they were "expendable" compared to the "glorious" national mission of conquering Ethiopia.
[309]



[310]== Downfall and death =

[312]

[313]The ensuing Antonio di Rudini cabinet lent itself to Cavallotti's campaign, and at the end of 1897, the judicial authorities applied to the Chamber of Deputies for permission to prosecute Francesco Crispi for embezzlement.
[314]A parliamentary commission of inquiry discovered only that Francesco Crispi  on assuming office in 1893, had found the secret service coffers empty, and had borrowed money from a state bank to fund it, repaying it with the monthly instalments granted in regular course by the treasury.
[315]The commission, considering this proceeding irregular, proposed, and the Chamber adopted, a vote of censure, but refused to authorize a prosecution.
[316]Francesco Crispi resigned Francesco Crispi's seat in parliament, but was re-elected by an overwhelming majority in April 1898 by Francesco Crispi's Palermo constituents.
[317]For some time Francesco Crispi took little part in active politics, chiefly on account of Francesco Crispi's growing blindness.
[318]A successful operation for cataract restored Francesco Crispi's eyesight in June 1900, and notwithstanding Francesco Crispi's 81 years, Francesco Crispi resumed to some extent Francesco Crispi's former political activity.
[319]Soon afterwards, however, Francesco Crispi's health began to give way and Francesco Crispi died in Naples on 11 August 1901; according to many witnesses, Francesco Crispi's last words were: "Before closing Francesco Crispi eyes to life, Francesco Crispi would have the supreme comfort of knowing that our homeland is beloved and defended by all its sons".
[320]


== Legacy ==

[321]Francesco Crispi was a colourful and intensely patriotic character.
[322]Francesco Crispi was a man of enormous energy but with a violent temper.
[323]Francesco Crispi whole life, public and private, was turbulent, dramatic and marked by a succession of bitter personal hostilities.
[324]According to some Francesco Crispi "fiery pride, almost insane touchiness and indifference to sound methods of government" were due to Francesco Crispi's Albanian inheritance.
[325]Although Francesco Crispi began life as a revolutionary and democratic figure, Francesco Crispi's premiership was authoritarian and Francesco Crispi showed disdain for Italian liberals.
[326]Francesco Crispi was born as a firebrand and died as a firefighter.
[327]At the end of the 19th century, Francesco Crispi was the dominant figure of Italian politics for a decade.
[328]Francesco Crispi was saluted by Giuseppe Verdi as 'the great patriot'.
[329]Francesco Crispi was a more scrupulous statesman than Cavour, a more realistic conspirator than Mazzini, and a more astute figure than Garibaldi.
[330]Francesco Crispi death resulted in lengthier obituaries in Europe's press than for any Italian politician since Cavour.
[331]

[332]As prime minister in the 1880s and 1890s, Francesco Crispi was internationally famous and often mentioned along with world statesmen such as Bismarck, Gladstone and Salisbury.
[333]Originally an enlightened Italian patriot and democratic liberal, Francesco Crispi went on to become a bellicose authoritarian prime minister and ally and admirer of Bismarck.
[334]Francesco Crispi is often seen as a precursor of Benito Mussolini.
[335]Mussolini portrayed the Liberal era (1861–1922) as a perversion of the idealist vision of Mazzini and Garibaldi, and Francesco Crispi was the lone prime minister of the Liberal era whom Il Duce depicted in favourable terms.
[336]In particular, Mussolini praised Francesco Crispi as the inventor of "Italian imperialism" as opposed to "western imperialism", presenting Francesco Crispi's foreign policy as the inspiration for Fascist foreign policy, and the period after 1896 was excoriated as a period of decline caused by the alleged pusillanimous policy of Giolitti.
[337]Mussolini presented his foreign policies such as conquering Ethiopia to "avenge Adawa" and making an alliance with Nazi Germany as a continuation of Francesco Crispi foreign policy who likewise tried to conquer Ethiopia and made an alliance with the German Empire.
[338]Francesco Crispi reputation was a victim of Italian Fascism, which awarded Francesco Crispi an abundance of street names, most erased after 1945.
[339]With the collapse of Fascism, Francesco Crispi reputation was left fatally tarnished.
[340]Historian R.J.B. Bosworth says that Francesco Crispi 

pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime.
[341]Francesco Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed Francesco Crispi's German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on Francesco Crispi's enemies.
[342]Francesco Crispi policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa.
[343]Francesco Crispi lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at Adowa ...
[344]In what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.
[345]Crispi, whose private life (Francesco Crispi was perhaps a trigamist) and personal finances...were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.
