[2]Alexej von Jawlensky was a key member of the New Munich Artist's Association (Neue Künstlervereinigung München), Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) group and later the Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four).
[3]



[4]== Life and work ==
Alexej von Jawlensky was born in Torzhok, a town in Tver Governorate, Russia, as the fifth child of Georgi von Jawlensky and his wife Alexandra (née Medwedewa).
[5]At the age of ten Alexej von Jawlensky moved with Alexej von Jawlensky's family to Moscow.
[6]After a few years of military training, Alexej von Jawlensky became interested in painting, visiting the Moscow World Exposition c. 1880.
[7]Thanks to Alexej von Jawlensky's good social connections, Alexej von Jawlensky managed to get Alexej von Jawlensky posted to St. Petersburg and, from 1889 to 1896, studied at the art academy there, while also discharging Alexej von Jawlensky's military duties.
[8]Alexej von Jawlensky gained admittance to the circle of the renowned Russian realist painter Ilya Repin.
[9]There Alexej von Jawlensky met Marianne von Werefkin, a wealthy artist and former student of Repin.
[10]Alexej von Jawlensky requested that Werefkin be Alexej von Jawlensky's mentor, and Werefkin decided to put her work on hold to promote Alexej von Jawlensky's work and provide Alexej von Jawlensky with a comfortable lifestyle.
[11]Alexej von Jawlensky and Werefkin moved to Munich in 1894, where Alexej von Jawlensky studied in the private school of Anton Ažbe.
[12]In 1905 Alexej von Jawlensky visited Ferdinand Hodler, and two years later Alexej von Jawlensky began Alexej von Jawlensky's long friendship with Jan Verkade and met Paul Sérusier.
[13]Together, Verkade and Sérusier transmitted to Alexej von Jawlensky both practical and theoretical elements of the work of the Nabis, and Synthetist principles of art.
[14]In Munich Alexej von Jawlensky met Wassily Kandinsky and various other Russian artists, and Alexej von Jawlensky contributed to the formation of the Neue Künstlervereinigung München.
[15]Alexej von Jawlensky work in this period was lush and richly coloured, but later moved towards abstraction and a simplified, formulaic style.
[16]Between 1908 and 1910 Alexej von Jawlensky and Werefkin spent summers in the Bavarian Alps with Kandinsky and his companion, the painter Gabriele Münter.
[17]Here, through painting landscapes of their mountainous surroundings, they experimented with one another's techniques and discussed the theoretical bases of their art.
[18]Following a trip to the Baltic coast, and renewed contact with Henri Matisse in 1911 and Emil Nolde in 1912, Alexej von Jawlensky turned increasingly to the expressive use of colour and form alone in Alexej von Jawlensky's portraits.
[19]

[20]Expelled from Germany in 1914 due to WWI, Alexej von Jawlensky moved to Switzerland.
[21]Alexej von Jawlensky met Emmy Scheyer in 1916 (Alexej von Jawlensky gave her the affectionate nickname, Galka, a Russian word for jackdaw), another artist who abandoned her own work to champion Alexej von Jawlensky's in the United States.
[22]After a hiatus in experimentation with the human form, Alexej von Jawlensky produced perhaps Alexej von Jawlensky's best-known series, the Mystical Heads (1917–19), and the Saviour’s Faces (1918–20), which are reminiscent of the traditional Russian Orthodox icons of Alexej von Jawlensky's childhood.
[23]In 1921, Alexej von Jawlensky returned to Germany and took up residence in Wiesbaden.
[24]There, in 1922, Alexej von Jawlensky married Werefkin's former maid Hélène Nesnakomoff, the mother of Alexej von Jawlensky's only son, Andreas, who was born before their marriage (1902).
[25] 
[26]In 1924 Alexej von Jawlensky established the Blue Four, whose works, thanks to Scheyer's tireless promotion, were jointly exhibited in Germany and the US.
[27]From 1929 Alexej von Jawlensky suffered from progressively crippling arthritis, which necessitated a reduced scale and finally forced a cessation in Alexej von Jawlensky's painting in 1937.
[28]Alexej von Jawlensky began to dictate Alexej von Jawlensky's memoirs in 1938.
[29]Alexej von Jawlensky died in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 15 March 1941.
[30]Alexej von Jawlensky and Alexej von Jawlensky's wife Helene are buried in the cemetery of St. Elizabeth's Church, Wiesbaden.
