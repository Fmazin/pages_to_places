[1]Cuthred or Cuþræd was the King of Wessex from 740 (739 according to Simeon of Durham, 741 according to John of Worcester) until 756.
[2] Cuthred of Wessex succeeded Æthelheard, Cuthred of Wessex's relative and possibly Cuthred of Wessex's brother.

[4]Cuthred of Wessex inherited the kingdom while Mercia was at its peak.
[5]The two kingdoms often fought in Cuthred of Wessex first three years, but it appears that Æthelbald of Mercia was Wessex's overlord and that Æthelbald compelled Cuthred of Wessex to join him in fighting the Welsh in 743.
[6]This alliance would not last long.
[7]Cuthred of Wessex reign was a troubled time.
[8]In 748, the Ætheling Cynric, son of Cuthred of Wessex  attempted to depose Cuthred of Wessex but he was killed.
[9]According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Æthelbald may have encouraged Cynric to rebel.
[10]In 750, the ealdorman Æthelhun led an unsuccessful rebellion he was winning until he was severely injured.
[11]In 752, Cuthred of Wessex  assisted by the now faithful Æthelhun, led a successful rebellion against Æthelbald at Battle Edge in Burford and secured independence from Mercia for the rest of Cuthred of Wessex's reign.
[12]Cuthred of Wessex is also said to have fought the Cornish in 753.
[13]

[14]Cuthred of Wessex died in 756, but Cuthred of Wessex left a stronger and more independent Wessex.
[15]Cuthred of Wessex was succeeded by Sigeberht who is identified as Cuthred of Wessex's distant relative.
