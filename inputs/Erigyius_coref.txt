[1]Erigyius (in Greek Ἐριγυιoς; died 328 BC), a Mytilenaean, son of Larichus, was an officer in Alexander the Great's army.
[2]Erigyius had been driven into banishment by Philip II, king of Macedon, because of Erigyius's faithful attachment to Alexander, and returned when the latter came to the throne in 336 BC.
[3]At the battle of Gaugamela, 331 BC, Erigyius commanded the cavalry of the allies, as Erigyius did also when Alexander set out in 330 BC from Ecbatana in pursuit of Darius III.
[4]the same year Erigyius was entrusted with the command of one of the three divisions with which Alexander invaded Hyrcania.
[5] 
[6]Erigyius was also among the generals sent against Satibarzanes, whom Erigyius slew in battle with Erigyius's own hand.
[7]In 329 BC, together with Craterus and Hephaestion, and with the assistance of Aristander, a soothsayer, Erigyius endeavoured to dissuade Alexander from crossing the Jaxartes river against the Scythians.
[8]In 328 BC Erigyius fell in a battle against the Bactrian fugitives.
