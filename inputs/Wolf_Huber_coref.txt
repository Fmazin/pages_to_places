[1]Wolf Huber (c. 1485 – 3 June 1553) was an Austrian- German painter, printmaker, and architect, who worked in Passau, Germany for most of Wolf Huber's life as a leading member of the Danube school.

== Life ==
Records show that Wolf Huber was born in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg, but that by 1515, Wolf Huber was living in Passau.  Wolf Huber relationship with other painters of that name living in Feldkirch is unknown, although it is widely believed that Wolf Huber was related to Hans Huber.
[3]Wolf Huber birthdate has been estimated at around 1485 on the basis of several works, dated between 1510–1515, which show Wolf Huber to have been a well-established and mature artist by that date.

[5]Nothing is known of Wolf Huber training, although Wolf Huber likely worked in a family workshop before setting out as a journeyman painter.
[6]Wolf Huber likely visited northern Italy, as much of Wolf Huber's work shows a thorough grounding in the stylistic techniques of the Italian Renaissance.
[7] 
[8]Drawings of local subjects reveal that Wolf Huber visited the Salzkammergut at least once.
[9]
After Wolf Huber's relocation to Passau, Wolf Huber in 1517 became court painter to the Duke of Bavaria, Ernst, who administered the local diocese until 1540.
[10] 
[11]In 1529 another local nobleman, Count Niklas II von Salm, commissioned Wolf Huber to rebuild Neuberg Palace on the Inn River, not far from the town, only fragments of which survive.
[12] These indicate the addition of wings in the style of the Italian Renaissance, complete with rich decorative paintings.  Wolf Huber probably also designed the reliefs on the tomb of the Count's father, Niklas I von Salm, now located in the Votivkirche in Vienna.
[13] 
[14]For Wolf Huber's work on the palace Wolf Huber was awarded a pension and a manor house, Neufels.
[15]When Count Wolfgang von Salm became Passau's bishop in 1542, he confirmed Wolf Huber status as court painter, further recording that Wolf Huber was not subject to the laws of the guild of painters.
[16]Wolf Huber died in Wolf Huber's manor house in Passau in 1553.

== Work ==
None of Wolf Huber architectural work has survived, and few of Wolf Huber's paintings are extant.
[18] Those paintings still in existence show a heavy influence from the work of Albrecht Dürer; some also show distinct Mannerist tendencies.  Almost none of Wolf Huber portraits survive, save for the pendants of mintmaster Anton Hundertpfund and his wife (dated 1526) and the unusual image of Jakob Ziegler (dated 1550), in which the scholar is presented frontally, before a panorama of the cosmos.
[19] Wolf Huber surviving drawings suggest a number of multi-figured compositions, now lost; Wolf Huber's known graphic output is limited to thirteen woodcuts.
[20]

[21]Wolf Huber drawings were copied from an early date; Wolf Huber's landscapes in particular bear a deal of resemblance to similar works by Albrecht Altdorfer.
[22]Wolf Huber influenced Wolf Huber's contemporary, the draughtsman Augustin Hirschvogel.
