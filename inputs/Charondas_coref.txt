[1]Charondas (Greek: Χαρώνδας) was a celebrated lawgiver of Catania in Sicily.
[2]It is uncertain when Charondas lived; some identify Charondas as a pupil of Pythagoras (c. 580 – 504 BC), but all that can be said is that Charondas lived earlier than Anaxilas of Rhegium (494 – 476 BC), as Charondas's laws were in use by the Rhegians until they were abolished by Anaxilas.
[3]Charondas laws, originally written in verse, were adopted by the other Chalcidic colonies in Sicily and Italy.

[5]According to Aristotle, there was nothing special about these laws except that Charondas introduced actions for perjury, but he speaks highly of the precision with which they were devised, while Plato speaks of Charondas positively in The Republic.
[6]The story that Charondas killed Charondas because Charondas entered the public assembly wearing a sword, which was a violation of Charondas's own law, is also told of Diocles of Syracuse and Zaleucus.
[7]The fragments of laws attributed to Charondas by Stobaeus and Diodorus are of late (Neo-Pythagorean) origin.
[8]Charondas is said to have commanded that if the nearest relative of an epikleros (something close to an heiress) did not wish to marry her, he was required to provide a dowry.
