[1]Alfred the Great (also spelled Ælfred; c. 849 – 26 October 899) was King of the West Saxons from 871 to 886, and King of the Anglo-Saxons from 886 until Alfred the Great's death in 899.
[2]Alfred the Great was the youngest son of King Æthelwulf and his first wife Osburh, who both died when Alfred the Great was young.
[3]Three of Alfred the Great brothers, Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred, reigned in turn before Alfred the Great 
[4]Under Alfred the Great rule, considerable administrative and military reforms were introduced, prompting lasting change in England.
[5]After ascending the throne, Alfred the Great spent several years fighting Viking invasions.
[6]Alfred the Great won a decisive victory in the Battle of Edington in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, dividing England between Anglo-Saxon territory and the Viking-ruled Danelaw, composed of Scandinavian York, the north-east Midlands and East Anglia.
[7]Alfred the Great also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader Guthrum to Christianity.
[8]Alfred the Great defended Alfred the Great's kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.
[9]Alfred the Great began styling Alfred the Great as "King of the Anglo-Saxons" after reoccupying London from the Vikings.
[10]Details of Alfred the Great's life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop Asser.

[11]Alfred the Great had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in English rather than Latin, and improving the legal system and military structure and Alfred the Great's people's quality of life.
[12]Alfred the Great was given the epithet "the Great" in the 16th century and is the only English monarch to be labelled as such.



[13]== Family ==

Alfred the Great was a son of Æthelwulf, king of Wessex, and his wife Osburh.
[14]According to Alfred the Great's biographer, Asser, writing in 893, "In the year of our Lord's Incarnation 849 Alfred the Great , was born at the royal estate called Wantage, in the district known as Berkshire ("which is so called from Berroc Wood, where the box tree grows very abundantly").
[15]This date has been accepted by the editors of Asser's biography, Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, and by other historians such as David Dumville and Richard Huscroft.
[16]West Saxon genealogical lists state that Alfred the Great was 23 when Alfred the Great became king in April 871, implying that Alfred the Great was born between April 847 and April 848.
[17]This dating is adopted in the biography of Alfred the Great by Alfred Smyth, who regards Asser's biography as fraudulent, an allegation which is rejected by other historians.
[18]Richard Abels in his biography discusses both sources but does not decide between them and dates Alfred the Great birth as 847/849, while Patrick Wormald in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article dates it 848/849.
[19]Berkshire had been historically disputed between Wessex and the midland kingdom of Mercia, and as late as 844, a charter showed that it was part of Mercia, but Alfred the Great birth in the county is evidence that, by the late 840s, control had passed to Wessex.
[20]Alfred the Great was the youngest of six children.
[21]Alfred the Great eldest brother, Æthelstan, was old enough to be appointed sub-king of Kent in 839, almost 10 years before Alfred the Great was born.
[22]He died in the early 850s.
[23]Alfred the Great next three brothers were successively kings of Wessex.
[24]Æthelbald (858–860) and Æthelberht (860–865) were also much older than Alfred the Great  but Æthelred (865–871) was only a year or two older.
[25]Alfred the Great only known sister, Æthelswith, married Burgred, king of Mercia in 853.
[26]Most historians think that Osburh was the mother of all Æthelwulf's children, but some suggest that the older ones were born to an unrecorded first wife.
[27]Osburh was descended from the rulers of the Isle of Wight.
[28]She was described by Alfred the Great biographer Asser as "a most religious woman, noble by temperament and noble by birth".
[29]She had died by 856 when Æthelwulf married Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, king of West Francia.
[30]In 868, Alfred the Great married Ealhswith, daughter of the Mercian nobleman Æthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, and his wife Eadburh, who was of royal Mercian descent.
[31]Their children were Æthelflæd, who married Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians; Edward the Elder, Alfred the Great successor as king; Æthelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury; Ælfthryth, who married Baldwin, count of Flanders; and Æthelweard.



[32]== Background ==
Alfred the Great grandfather, Ecgberht, became king of Wessex in 802, and in the view of the historian Richard Abels, it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty.
[33]For 200 years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king.
[34]No ancestor of Ecgberht had been a king of Wessex since Ceawlin in the late sixth century, but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty.
[35]This made Ecgberht an ætheling – a prince eligible for the throne.
[36]But after Ecgberht's reign, descent from Cerdic was no longer sufficient to make a man an ætheling.
[37]When Ecgberht died in 839, he was succeeded by his son Æthelwulf; all subsequent West Saxon kings were descendants of Ecgberht and Æthelwulf, and were also sons of kings.
[38]At the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the Anglo-Saxons.
[39]Mercia dominated southern England, but its supremacy came to an end in 825 when it was decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellendun.
[40]Mercia and Wessex became allies, which was important in the resistance to Viking attacks.
[41]In 853, King Burgred of Mercia requested West Saxon help to suppress a Welsh rebellion, and Æthelwulf led a West Saxon contingent in a successful joint campaign.
[42]In the same year Burgred married Æthelwulf's daughter, Æthelswith.
[43]In 825, Ecgberht sent Æthelwulf to invade the Mercian sub-kingdom of Kent, and its sub-king, Baldred, was driven out shortly afterwards.
[44]By 830, Essex, Surrey and Sussex had submitted to Ecgberht, and he had appointed Æthelwulf to rule the south-eastern territories as king of Kent.
[45]The Vikings ravaged the Isle of Sheppey in 835, and the following year they defeated Ecgberht at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing Cornwall to the status of a client kingdom.
[46]When Æthelwulf succeeded to the throne, he appointed his eldest son Æthelstan as sub-king of Kent.
[47]Ecgberht and Æthelwulf may not have intended a permanent union between Wessex and Kent because they both appointed sons as sub-kings, and charters in Wessex were attested (witnessed) by West Saxon magnates, while Kentish charters were witnessed by the Kentish elite; both kings kept overall control, and the sub-kings were not allowed to issue their own coinage.
[48]Viking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the English Channel, and in 843 Æthelwulf was defeated at Carhampton.
[49]In 850, Æthelstan defeated a Danish fleet off Sandwich in the first recorded naval battle in English history.
[50]In 851 Æthelwulf and his second son, Æthelbald, defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea and, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, "there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen raiding-army that we have heard tell of up to this present day, and there took the victory".
[51]Æthelwulf died in 858 and was succeeded by his oldest surviving son, Æthelbald, as king of Wessex and by his next oldest son, Æthelberht, as king of Kent.
[52]Æthelbald only survived his father by two years, and Æthelberht then for the first time united Wessex and Kent into a single kingdom.



[53]== Childhood ==
According to Asser, in Alfred the Great's childhood Alfred the Great won a beautifully decorated book of English poetry, offered as a prize by Alfred the Great's mother to the first of her sons able to memorise it.
[54]Alfred the Great must have had it read to Alfred the Great because Alfred the Great's mother died when Alfred the Great was about six and Alfred the Great did not learn to read until Alfred the Great was 12.
[55]In 853, Alfred the Great is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have been sent to Rome where Alfred the Great was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who "anointed Alfred the Great as king".
[56]Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for Alfred the Great's eventual succession to the throne of Wessex.
[57]This is unlikely; Alfred the Great's succession could not have been foreseen at the time because Alfred the Great had three living elder brothers.
[58]A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred the Great was made a "consul" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.
[59]It may be based upon the fact that Alfred the Great later accompanied Alfred the Great's father on a pilgrimage to Rome where Alfred the Great spent some time at the court of Charles the Bald, king of the Franks, around 854–855.
[60]On their return from Rome in 856, Æthelwulf was deposed by his son Æthelbald.
[61]With civil war looming, the magnates of the realm met in council to form a compromise.
[62]Æthelbald retained the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf ruled in the east.
[63]After King Æthelwulf died in 858, Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred the Great brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred.



[64]==
[65]The reigns of Alfred the Great brothers ==
Alfred the Great is not mentioned during the short reigns of Alfred the Great's older brothers Æthelbald and Æthelberht.
[66]The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the Great Heathen Army of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.
[67]Alfred the Great public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of Alfred the Great's third brother, 18-year-old Æthelred.
[68]During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the Great the unique title of secundarius, which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic tanist, a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch.
[69]This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred the Great father or by the Witan to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle.
[70]It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples – such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related – to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander.



[71]=== Viking invasion
[72]===
In 868, Alfred the Great was recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by Ivar the Boneless out of the adjoining Kingdom of Mercia.
[73]The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded.
[74]A successful skirmish at the Battle of Englefield in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the Battle of Reading by Ivar's brother Halfdan Ragnarsson on 5 January 871.
[75]Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a victory at the Battle of Ashdown on the Berkshire Downs, possibly near Compton or Aldworth.
[76]The Saxons were defeated at the Battle of Basing on 22 January.
[77]They were defeated again on 22 March at the Battle of Merton (perhaps Marden in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset).
[78]Æthelred died shortly afterwards in April 871.



[79]== King at war ==


=== Early struggles ===
In April 871
[80]King Æthelred died and Alfred the Great acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold.
[81]This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred the Great had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg.
[82]The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will.
[83]The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired.
[84]The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king.
[85]Given the Danish invasion and the youth of Alfred the Great's nephews, Alfred the Great accession probably went uncontested.
[86]While Alfred the Great was busy with the burial ceremonies for Alfred the Great's brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in Alfred the Great's absence at an unnamed spot and then again in Alfred the Great's presence at Wilton in May.
[87]The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred the Great could drive the invaders from Alfred the Great's kingdom.
[88]Alfred the Great was forced instead to make peace with them.
[89]Although the terms of the peace are not recorded, Bishop Asser wrote that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.
[90]The Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London.
[91]Although not mentioned by Asser or by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Alfred the Great probably paid the Vikings silver to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.
[92]Hoards dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/872 have been excavated at Croydon, Gravesend and Waterloo Bridge.
[93]These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings.
[94]For the next five years, the Danes occupied other parts of England.
[95]In 876, under Guthrum, Oscetel and Anwend, the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied Wareham in Dorset.
[96]Alfred the Great blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.
[97]Alfred the Great negotiated a peace that involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a "holy ring" associated with the worship of Thor.
[98]The Danes broke their word, and after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to Exeter in Devon.
[99]Alfred the Great blockaded the Viking ships in Devon, and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit.
[100]The Danes withdrew to Mercia.
[101]In January 878, the Danes made a sudden attack on Chippenham, a royal stronghold in which Alfred the Great had been staying over Christmas "and most of the people they killed, except Alfred the Great  and Alfred the Great with a little band made Alfred the Great's way by wood and swamp, and after Easter Alfred the Great made a fort at Athelney in the marshes of Somerset, and from that fort kept fighting against the foe".
[102]From Alfred the Great's fort at Athelney, an island in the marshes near North Petherton, Alfred the Great was able to mount a resistance campaign, rallying the local militias from Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.
[103]878 was the nadir of the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.
[104]With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was resisting.



[105]=== Legend of burnt cake ===
Having fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred the Great was purportedly given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of Alfred the Great's identity, asked Alfred the Great to mind some wheaten cakes she left baking by the fire.
[106]Preoccupied with the problems of Alfred the Great's kingdom, Alfred the Great accidentally let the cakes burn, and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return.
[107]The first written account of the legend appears a century after Alfred the Great death, though may have earlier origins in folklore.



[108]=== Counter-attack and victory ===
In the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around Whitsuntide, Alfred the Great rode to Egbert's Stone east of Selwood where Alfred the Great was met by "all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see Alfred the Great .
[109]Alfred the Great emergence from Alfred the Great's marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires.
[110]This meant not only that Alfred the Great had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer Alfred the Great's summons to war.
[111]Alfred the Great actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.
[112]Alfred the Great won a decisive victory in the ensuing Battle of Edington which may have been fought near Westbury, Wiltshire.
[113]Alfred the Great then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at Chippenham and starved them into submission.
[114]One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to Christianity.
[115]Three weeks later, the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred the Great court at Aller, near Athelney, with Alfred the Great receiving Guthrum as Alfred the Great's spiritual son.
[116]According to Asser,

The unbinding of the chrisom on the eighth day took place at a royal estate called Wedmore.

[117]At Wedmore, Alfred the Great and Guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the Treaty of Wedmore, but it was to be some years after the cessation of hostilities that a formal treaty was signed.
[118]Under the terms of the so-called Treaty of Wedmore, the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia.
[119]Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester.
[120]The formal Treaty of Alfred the Great and Guthrum, preserved in Old English in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (Manuscript 383), and in a Latin compilation known as Quadripartitus, was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King Ceolwulf II of Mercia was deposed.
[121]That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia.
[122]By its terms, the boundary between Alfred the Great and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the River Thames to the River Lea, follow the Lea to its source (near Luton), from there extend in a straight line to Bedford, and from Bedford follow the River Ouse to Watling Street.
[123]Alfred the Great succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged Kingdom of East Anglia (henceforward known as the Danelaw).
[124]By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred the Great was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints—at least for the time being.
[125]In 825, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle had recorded that the people of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey surrendered to Egbert, Alfred the Great grandfather.
[126]From then until the arrival of the Great Heathen Army, Essex had formed part of Wessex.
[127]After the foundation of Danelaw, it appears that some of Essex would have been ceded to the Danes, but how much is not clear.



[128]=== 880s ===

With the signing of the Treaty of Alfred the Great and Guthrum, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat.
[129]The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878–879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879 to 892.There were local raids on the coast of Wessex throughout the 880s.
[130]In 882, Alfred the Great fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships.
[131]Two of the ships were destroyed, and the others surrendered.
[132]This was one of four sea battles recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, three of which involved Alfred the Great 
[133]Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period as they had for decades.
[134]In 883, Pope Marinus exempted the Saxon quarter in Rome from taxation, probably in return for Alfred the Great promise to send alms annually to Rome, which may be the origin of the medieval tax called Peter's Pence.
[135]The pope sent gifts to Alfred the Great  including what was reputed to be a piece of the True Cross.
[136]After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred the Great was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time.
[137]Despite this relative peace, Alfred the Great was forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions.
[138]Among these was a raid in Kent, an allied kingdom in South East England, during the year 885, which was possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum.
[139]Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of Rochester, where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city.
[140]In response to this incursion, Alfred the Great led an Anglo-Saxon force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain.
[141]The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.
[142]Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred the Great dispatched Alfred the Great's fleet to East Anglia.
[143]The purpose of this expedition is debated, but Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.
[144]After travelling up the River Stour, the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number), and a battle ensued.
[145]The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious, and as Henry of Huntingdon writes, "laden with spoils".
[146]The victorious fleet was surprised when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river.
[147]The Danish fleet defeated Alfred the Great fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.



[148]=== King of the Anglo-Saxons ===
A year later, in 886, Alfred the Great reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.
[149]Alfred the Great entrusted the city to the care of Alfred the Great's son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia.
[150]Soon afterwards, Alfred the Great restyled Alfred the Great as "King of the Anglo-Saxons".
[151]The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the River Thames.
[152]This is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred the Great 
[153]In 888, Æthelred, the archbishop of Canterbury, also died.
[154]One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred the Great former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in Hadleigh, Suffolk.
[155]Guthrum's death changed the political landscape for Alfred the Great 
[156]The resulting power vacuum stirred other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years.



[157]=== Viking attacks (890s) ===
After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again.
[158]Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions.
[159]They entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser under Hastein, at Milton, also in Kent.
[160]The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation.
[161]Alfred the Great  in 893 or 894, took up a position from which Alfred the Great could observe both forces.
[162]While Alfred the Great was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards.
[163]They were overtaken by Alfred the Great eldest son Edward, and were defeated at the Battle of Farnham in Surrey.
[164]They took refuge on an island at Thorney, on the River Colne between Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.
[165]They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at Benfleet, joined with Hastein's force at Shoebury.
[166]Alfred the Great had been on Alfred the Great's way to relieve Alfred the Great's son at Thorney when Alfred the Great heard that the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were besieging Exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the North Devon shore.
[167]Alfred the Great at once hurried westward and raised the Siege of Exeter.
[168]The fate of the other place is not recorded.
[169]The force under Hastein set out to march up the Thames Valley, possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west.
[170]They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of Mercia, Wiltshire and Somerset and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at Buttington.
[171](Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the River Wye, others with Buttington near Welshpool.)
[172]An attempt to break through the English lines failed.
[173]Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury.
[174]After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined Roman walls of Chester.
[175]The English did not attempt a winter blockade but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.
[176]Early in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to Essex.
[177]At the end of the year, the Danes drew their ships up the River Thames and the River Lea and fortified themselves twenty miles (32 km) north of London.
[178]A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred the Great saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships.
[179]The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at Cwatbridge near Bridgnorth.
[180]The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle.
[181]Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia.
[182]Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.



[183]== Military reorganisation ==
The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.
[184]The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.
[185]According to the law code of King Ine of Wessex, issued in c. 694,

If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service
Wessex's history of failures preceding Alfred the Great success in 878 emphasised to Alfred the Great that the traditional system of battle Alfred the Great had inherited played to the Danes' advantage.
[186]While the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements for plunder, they employed different tactics.
[187]In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a shield wall, advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.
[188]The Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays to avoid risking their plunder with high-stake attacks for more.
[189]Alfred the Great determined their tactic was to launch small attacks from a secure base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.
[190]The bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with ditches, ramparts and palisades.
[191]Once inside the fortification, Alfred the Great realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack because the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.
[192]The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings.
[193]It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids.
[194]The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but in the case of the Viking raids, problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough.
[195]It was only after the raids had begun that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle.
[196]Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive.
[197]Although the landowners were obliged to Alfred the Great to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them abandoned Alfred the Great and collaborated with Guthrum.
[198]With these lessons in mind Alfred the Great capitalised on the relatively peaceful years following Alfred the Great's victory at Edington with an ambitious restructuring of Saxon defences.
[199]On a trip to Rome Alfred the Great had stayed with Charles the Bald, and it is possible that Alfred the Great may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with Viking raiders.
[200]Learning from their experiences Alfred the Great was able to establish a system of taxation and defence for Wessex.
[201]There had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence.
[202]When the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred the Great was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.



[203]=== Administration and taxation ===
Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called "common burdens" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair.
[204]This threefold obligation has traditionally been called trinoda necessitas or trimoda necessitas.
[205]The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was fierdwite.
[206]To maintain the burhs, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred the Great expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding.
[207]The hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed.
[208]A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family.
[209]The hide differed in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned.



[210]=== Burghal system ===

The foundation of Alfred the Great new military defence system was a network of burhs, distributed at tactical points throughout the kingdom.
[211]There were thirty-three burhs, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.
[212]Alfred the Great burhs (of which 22 developed into boroughs) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden revetments and palisades, such as at Burpham in West Sussex.
[213]The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.
[214]A document now known as the Burghal Hidage provides an insight into how the system worked.
[215]It lists the hidage for each of the fortified towns contained in the document.
[216]Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining 9,900 feet (1.88 miles; 3.0 kilometres) of wall.
[217]A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.
[218]Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by Charles the Bald a generation before.
[219]The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears or arrows.
[220]Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing Alfred the Great better control over Alfred the Great's strongholds.
[221]The burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as herepaths).
[222]The roads allowed an army quickly to be assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.
[223]The road network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty.
[224]The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them.
[225]The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of siegecraft, having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications.
[226]The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave Alfred the Great time to send Alfred the Great's field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads.
[227]In such cases, the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by Alfred the Great joint military forces.
[228]Alfred the Great burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-built, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in Kent, the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.
[229]Alfred the Great burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution.
[230]Alfred the Great contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the demands placed upon them even though they were for "the common needs of the kingdom".



[231]=== English navy ===
Alfred the Great also tried Alfred the Great's hand at naval design.
[232]In 896 Alfred the Great ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships.
[233]This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy.
[234]Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this.
[235]Alfred the Great older brother sub-king Æthelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships and Alfred the Great had conducted naval actions in 882.
[236]The year 897 marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex.
[237]The author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle related that Alfred the Great ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships.
[238]It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred the Great used the design of Greek and Roman warships, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.
[239]Alfred the Great had seapower in mind; if Alfred the Great could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, Alfred the Great could spare Alfred the Great's kingdom from being ravaged.
[240]Alfred the Great ships may have been superior in conception, but in practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could be fought.
[241]The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers.
[242]It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an opposing vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the craft.
[243]The result was a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.
[244]In the one recorded naval engagement in 896, Alfred the Great new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England.
[245]The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.
[246]Alfred the Great ships immediately moved to block their escape.
[247]The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines.
[248]Only one made it; Alfred the Great ships intercepted the other two.
[249]Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings.
[250]One ship escaped because Alfred the Great heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.
[251]A land battle ensued between the crews.
[252]The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose, they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first.
[253]The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them but they suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea.
[254]All were too damaged to row around Sussex, and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at Selsey Bill).
[255]The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred the Great at Winchester and hanged.



[256]== Legal reform ==

In the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred the Great issued a long domboc or law code consisting of Alfred the Great's own laws, followed by a code issued by Alfred the Great's late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex.
[257]Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters.
[258]In Alfred the Great's introduction Alfred the Great explains that Alfred the Great gathered together the laws Alfred the Great found in many "synod-books" and "ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased Alfred the Great  and many of the ones that did not please Alfred the Great  Alfred the Great rejected with the advice of Alfred the Great councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way".
[259]Alfred the Great singled out in particular the laws that Alfred the Great "found in the days of Ine, Alfred the Great kinsman, or Offa, king of the Mercians, or King Æthelberht of Kent who first among the English people received baptism".
[260]Alfred the Great appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into Alfred the Great's code and although Alfred the Great included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned.
[261]Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian Patrick Wormald to speculate that Alfred the Great had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by the papal legate George of Ostia.
[262]About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred the Great introduction which includes translations into English of the Ten Commandments, a few chapters from the Book of Exodus, and the Apostolic Letter from the Acts of the Apostles (15:23–29).
[263]The introduction may best be understood as Alfred the Great meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.
[264]It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred the Great own issuance of law to the West Saxon people.
[265]By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred the Great law-giving as a type of divine legislation.
[266]Similarly Alfred the Great divided Alfred the Great's code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.
[267]The link between Mosaic law and Alfred the Great code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Alfred the Great "had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and Alfred the Great taught mercy and meekness" (Intro, 49.1).
[268]The mercy that Alfred the Great infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods "established, through that mercy which Alfred the Great taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed".
[269]The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord "since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Alfred the Great  adjudge any for the one who betrayed Alfred the Great to death; and Alfred the Great commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself".
[270]Alfred the Great transformation of Alfred the Great commandment, from "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Matt. 22:39–40) to love your secular lord as you would love Alfred the Great  underscores the importance that Alfred the Great placed upon lordship which Alfred the Great understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.
[271]When one turns from the domboc's introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement.
[272]The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws.
[273]The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits.
[274]In fact, several of Alfred the Great laws contradicted the laws of Ine that form an integral part of the code.
[275]Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred the Great law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship "designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction".
[276]In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the first: "We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.
[277]Alfred the Great devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters.
[278]Asser underscores Alfred the Great's concern for judicial fairness.
[279]Alfred the Great  according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by Alfred the Great's ealdormen and reeves and "would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in Alfred the Great's absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust".
[280]A charter from the reign of Alfred the Great's son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred the Great as hearing one such appeal in Alfred the Great's chamber while washing Alfred the Great's hands.
[281]Asser represents Alfred the Great as a Solomonic judge, painstaking in Alfred the Great's own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments.
[282]Although Asser never mentions Alfred the Great law code he does say that Alfred the Great insisted that Alfred the Great's judges be literate so that they could apply themselves "to the pursuit of wisdom".
[283]The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.
[284]The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, commissioned at the time of Alfred the Great  was probably written to promote unification of England, whereas Asser's The Life of King Alfred promoted Alfred the Great achievements and personal qualities.
[285]It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales because Alfred the Great had acquired overlordship of that country.



[286]== Foreign relations ==
Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred the Great relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.
[287]Alfred the Great interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which Alfred the Great made in Alfred the Great's translation of Orosius.
[288]Alfred the Great corresponded with Elias III, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the pope were fairly frequent.
[289]Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso.
[290]Alfred the Great personally collected details of this trip.
[291]Alfred the Great relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of Great Britain are clearer.
[292]Comparatively early in Alfred the Great's reign, according to Asser, the southern Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them from North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred the Great 
[293]Later in Alfred the Great's reign, the North Welsh followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894).
[294]That Alfred the Great sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority.
[295]The visit of three pilgrim "Scots" (i.e., Irish) to Alfred the Great in 891 is undoubtedly authentic.
[296]The story that, in Alfred the Great's childhood, Alfred the Great was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint Modwenna may show Alfred the Great interest in that island.



[297]== Religion, education and culture ==
In the 880s, at the same time that Alfred the Great was "cajoling and threatening" Alfred the Great's nobles to build and man the burhs, Alfred the Great  perhaps inspired by the example of Charlemagne almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.
[298]During this period, the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment, and Alfred the Great may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.
[299]This revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the episcopacy; the establishment of a court school to educate Alfred the Great's own children, the sons of Alfred the Great's nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works Alfred the Great deemed "most necessary for all men to know"; the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred the Great kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.
[300]Very little is known of the church under Alfred the Great 
[301]The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries.
[302]Although Alfred the Great founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.
[303]According to Asser, Alfred the Great enticed foreign monks to England for Alfred the Great's monastery at Athelney because there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.
[304]Alfred the Great undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex.
[305]For Alfred the Great  the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots.
[306]As king, Alfred the Great saw Alfred the Great as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of Alfred the Great's subjects.
[307]Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred the Great 
[308]Alfred the Great was equally comfortable distributing Alfred the Great's translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care to Alfred the Great's bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges.
[309]Nor did Alfred the Great's piety prevent Alfred the Great from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal thegns and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.



[310]=== Effect of Danish raids on education ===
The Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England.
[311]Alfred the Great lamented in the preface to Alfred the Great's translation of Gregory's Pastoral Care that "learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and Alfred the Great suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either".
[312]Alfred the Great undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during Alfred the Great's youth.
[313]That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in Alfred the Great's court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.
[314]Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.
[315]Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt along with the churches that housed them.
[316]A solemn diploma from Christ Church, Canterbury, dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian Nicholas Brooks posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin.
[317]"It is clear", Brooks concludes, "that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship".



[318]=== Establishment of a court school ===
Alfred the Great established a court school for the education of Alfred the Great's own children, those of the nobility, and "a good many of lesser birth".
[319]There they studied books in both English and Latin and "devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent… they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts".
[320]Alfred the Great recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide Alfred the Great personal instruction.
[321]Grimbald and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred the Great appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Wærferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.



[322]=== Advocacy of education in English ===
Alfred the Great educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school.
[323]Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred the Great aimed "to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it".
[324]Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in Alfred the Great's realm, Alfred the Great proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.
[325]There were few "books of wisdom" written in English.
[326]Alfred the Great sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books Alfred the Great deemed "most necessary for all men to know".
[327]It is unknown when Alfred the Great launched this programme, but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks.
[328]Alfred the Great was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations, but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases.
[329]Scholars more often refer to translations as "Alfredian", indicating that they probably had something to do with Alfred the Great's patronage, but are unlikely to be Alfred the Great's own work.
[330]Apart from the lost Handboc or Encheiridio, which seems to have been a commonplace book kept by Alfred the Great  the earliest work to be translated was the Dialogues of Gregory the Great, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages.
[331]The translation was undertaken at Alfred the Great command by Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester, with Alfred the Great merely furnishing a preface.
[332]Remarkably, Alfred the Great – undoubtedly with the advice and aid of Alfred the Great's court scholars – translated four works Alfred the Great  Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, St. Augustine's Soliloquies and the first fifty psalms of the Psalter.
[333]One might add to this list the translation, in Alfred the Great law code, of excerpts from the Vulgate Book of Exodus.
[334]The Old English versions of Orosius's Histories against the Pagans and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred the Great own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.
[335]Nonetheless, the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation.
[336]Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's Leechbook and the anonymous Old English Martyrology.
[337]The preface of Alfred the Great translation of Pope Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care explained why Alfred the Great thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English.
[338]Although Alfred the Great described Alfred the Great's method as translating "sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense", the translation keeps very close to the original although, through Alfred the Great's choice of language, Alfred the Great blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority.
[339]Alfred the Great meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all Alfred the Great's bishops.
[340]Interest in Alfred the Great translation of Pastoral Care was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.
[341]Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages.
[342]Unlike the translation of the Pastoral Care, the Alfredian text deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred the Great Alfred the Great but to the glosses and commentaries which Alfred the Great used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred the Great milieu.
[343]It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: "To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works."
[344]The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only.
[345]In one of these the writing is prose, in the other a combination of prose and alliterating verse.
[346]The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.
[347]The last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name Blostman ('Blooms') or Anthology.
[348]The first half is based mainly on the Soliloquies of St Augustine of Hippo, the remainder is drawn from various sources.
[349]The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred the Great own and highly characteristic of Alfred the Great 
[350]The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings.
[351]"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear."
[352]Alfred the Great appears as a character in the twelfth- or 13th-century poem The Owl and the Nightingale where Alfred the Great's wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised.
[353]The Proverbs of Alfred, a 13th-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred the Great but attest to Alfred the Great's posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.

[354]The Alfred jewel, discovered in Somerset in 1693, has long been associated with Alfred the Great because of its Old English inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred the Great ordered me to be made').
[355]The jewel is about 2+1⁄2 inches (6.4 centimetres) long, made of filigreed gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonné enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.
[356]It was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base.
[357]The jewel certainly dates from Alfred the Great reign.
[358]Although its function is unknown, it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the æstels – pointers for reading – that Alfred the Great ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of Alfred the Great's translation of the Pastoral Care.
[359]Each æstel was worth the princely sum of 50 mancuses which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred the Great jewel.
[360]Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred the Great educational and military reforms as complementary.
[361]Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred the Great mind as essential to the defence of Alfred the Great's realm as the building of the burhs.
[362]As Alfred the Great observed in the preface to Alfred the Great's English translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.
[363]The pursuit of wisdom, Alfred the Great assured Alfred the Great's readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: "Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for Alfred the Great tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it".
[364]The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda.
[365]It reflected Alfred the Great own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers.
[366]The need to persuade Alfred the Great's nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that Alfred the Great had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings including Offa, clerical writers including Bede, and Alcuin and various participants in the Carolingian renaissance.
[367]This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate Alfred the Great's subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred the Great worldview.
[368]Alfred the Great believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted Alfred the Great with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of Alfred the Great's people.
[369]If the Christian faith fell into ruin in Alfred the Great's kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, Alfred the Great was answerable before God, as Josiah had been.
[370]Alfred the Great ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of Alfred the Great's people.



[371]== Appearance and character ==
Asser wrote of Alfred the Great in his Life of King Alfred,

Now, Alfred the Great was greatly loved, more than all Alfred the Great's brothers, by Alfred the Great's father and mother—indeed, by everybody—with a universal and profound love, and Alfred the Great was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else...[Alfred the Great  was seen to be more comely in appearance than Alfred the Great's other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour...
[372][and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of Alfred the Great's birth, which have characterized the nature of Alfred the Great's noble mind.

[373]It is also written by Asser that Alfred the Great did not learn to read until Alfred the Great was 12 years old or later, which is described as "shameful negligence" of Alfred the Great's parents and tutors.
[374]Alfred the Great was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and Alfred the Great retained poetry and psalms very well.
[375]A story is told by Asser about how Alfred the Great's mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's brothers, and said; "I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest."
[376]After excitedly asking, "Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?"
[377]Alfred the Great then took it to Alfred the Great's teacher, learned it, and recited it back to Alfred the Great's mother.
[378]Alfred the Great is noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, that contained psalms and many prayers that Alfred the Great often collected.
[379]Asser writes: these "Alfred the Great collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life Alfred the Great took it around with Alfred the Great everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it."
[380]An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred the Great is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.
[381]Alfred the Great was the youngest of Alfred the Great's brothers, and Alfred the Great was probably the most open-minded.
[382]Alfred the Great was an early advocate for education.
[383]Alfred the Great desire for learning could have come from Alfred the Great's early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life.
[384]Asser writes that Alfred the Great "could not satisfy Alfred the Great's craving for what Alfred the Great desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time".



[385]== Family ==
In 868, Alfred the Great married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini.
[386]The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians.
[387]Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.
[388]They had five or six children together, including Edward the Elder who succeeded Alfred the Great as king; Æthelflæd who became lady of the Mercians; and Ælfthryth who married Baldwin II, Count of Flanders.
[389]Alfred the Great mother was Osburga, daughter of Oslac of the Isle of Wight, Chief Butler of England.
[390]Asser, in his Vita Ælfredi asserts that this shows Alfred the Great's lineage from the Jutes of the Isle of Wight.

[391]Osferth was described as a relative in Alfred the Great will and he attested charters in a high position until 934.
[392]A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother – mistakenly according to Keynes and Lapidge, but in the view of Janet Nelson, he probably was an illegitimate son of Alfred the Great 



[393]== Death and burial ==
Alfred the Great died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51.
[394]How Alfred the Great died is unknown, but Alfred the Great suffered throughout Alfred the Great's life with a painful and unpleasant illness.
[395]Alfred the Great biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred the Great symptoms, and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis.
[396]It is thought that Alfred the Great had either Crohn's disease or haemorrhoids.
[397]Alfred the Great grandson King Eadred seems to have had a similar illness.
[398]Alfred the Great was temporarily buried at the Old Minster in Winchester with Alfred the Great's wife Ealhswith and later, Alfred the Great's son Edward the Elder.
[399]Before Alfred the Great's death Alfred the Great had ordered the construction of the New Minster hoping that it would become a mausoleum for Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's family.
[400]Four years after Alfred the Great's death, the bodies of Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's family were exhumed and moved to their new resting place in the New Minster and remained there for 211 years.
[401]When William the Conqueror rose to the English throne after the Norman conquest in 1066, many Anglo-Saxon abbeys were demolished and replaced with Norman cathedrals.
[402]One of those unfortunate abbeys was the very New Minster abbey where Alfred the Great was laid to rest.
[403]Before demolition, the monks at the New Minster exhumed the bodies of Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's family to safely transfer them to a new location.
[404]The New Minster monks moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and they transferred to Hyde Abbey along with Alfred the Great body and those of Alfred the Great's wife and children, which were interred before the high altar.
[405]In 1536, many Roman Catholic churches were vandalized by the people of England spurred by disillusionment with the church during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
[406]One such Catholic church was the site of Alfred the Great burial, Hyde Abbey.
[407]Once again, Alfred the Great place of rest was disturbed for the now 3rd time.
[408]Hyde Abbey was dissolved in 1538 during the reign of Henry VIII, the church site was demolished and treated like a quarry, as the stones that made up the abbey were then re-used in local architecture.
[409]The stone graves housing Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's family stayed underground, and the land returned to farming.
[410]These graves remained intact until 1788 when the site was acquired by the county for the construction of a town jail.


[411]Before construction began, convicts that would later be imprisoned at the site were sent in to prepare the ground, to ready it for building.
[412]While digging the foundation trenches, the convicts discovered the coffins of Alfred the Great and Alfred the Great's family.
[413]The local Catholic priest, Dr. Milner recounts this event:Thus miscreants couch amidst the ashes of our Alfreds and Edwards; and where once religious silence and contemplation were only interrupted by the bell of regular observance, the chanting of devotion, now alone resound the clank of the captives chains and the oaths of the profligate!
[414]In digging for the foundation of that mournful edifice, at almost every stroke of the mattock or spade some ancient sepulchre was violated, the venerable contents of which were treated with marked indignity.
[415]On this occasion a great number of stone coffins were dug up, with a variety of other curious articles, such as chalices, patens, rings, buckles, the leather of shoes and boots, velvet and gold lace belonging to chasubles and other vestments; as also the crook, rims, and joints of a beautiful crosier double gilt.
[416]The convicts broke the stone coffins into pieces, the lead, which lined the coffins, was sold for two guineas, and the bones within scattered around the area.
[417]The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.
[418]Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.
[419]In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred the Great 
[420]These came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.
[421]Excavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1866 excavation.
[422]The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones, suggested at the time to be those of Alfred the Great  they proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.
[423]In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage.
[424]The diocese made no claim that they were the bones of Alfred the Great  but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of Richard III.
[425]The bones were radiocarbon-dated but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore not of Alfred the Great 
[426]In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis that had been unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, and had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period.
[427]It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred the Great or Alfred the Great's son Edward, but this remains unproven.

Henry VI of England attempted unsuccessfully to have Alfred the Great canonized by Pope Eugene IV in 1441.
[429]The current "Roman Martyrology" does not mention Alfred the Great 
[430]The Anglican Communion venerates Alfred the Great as a Christian hero, with a Lesser Festival on 26 October, and Alfred the Great may often be found depicted in stained glass in Church of England parish churches.

[435]Later medieval historians such as Geoffrey of Monmouth also reinforced Alfred the Great favourable image.
[436]By the time of the Reformation, Alfred the Great was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that Alfred the Great commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans.
[437]Consequently, it was writers of the 16th century who gave Alfred the Great Alfred the Great's epithet as "the Great", not any of Alfred the Great contemporaries.
[438]The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred the Great patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.
[439]A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred the Great honour:

The University of Winchester created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)

[440]Alfred University and Alfred State College in Alfred, New York; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of the year of Alfred the Great ascension to the throne.

The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK
Alfred the Great house in Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield
King Alfred Swimming Pool & Leisure complex in Hove, Brighton UKThe Royal Navy named one ship and two shore establishments HMS King Alfred, and one of the early ships of the U.S. Navy was named USS Alfred in Alfred the Great's honour.
