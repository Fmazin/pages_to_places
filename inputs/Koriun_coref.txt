[1]Koriun (Armenian: Կորիւն, reformed spelling: Կորյուն; also transliterated as Koriwn, Koryun, Coriun) was the earliest Armenian-language author.
[2]Writing in the fifth century, Koriun's Life of Mashtots contains many details about the evangelization of Armenia and the invention of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots.
[3]Some Armenian and European scholars, such as G. Alishan, O. Torosyan, G. Fintigliyan, A. Sarukhan, G. Ter-Mkrtchyan (Miaban), S. Weber and others, have speculated that Koriun could have been Iberian-Armenian or Iberian (Georgian).

[5]Date and place of Koriun's birth are not known.
[6]Koriun Koriun literally means "lion kid".
[7]Koriun became one of the earliest disciples of Mesrop Mashtots while Koriun was very young.
[8]

[9]According to Armenian and European scholars, Koriun was elevated to the rank of bishop of Iberia.
[10]Having received Koriun's early education under Mashtots, Koriun went to Byzantium for higher studies, returning to Armenia with other students in 432.
[11]Koriun was a close friend of Eznik of Kolb and Ghevond.
[12]Later, Koriun was appointed Bishop of Georgia.
[13]Koriun has been listed among the junior translators.
[14]Koriun style is original, but somewhat obscure due to grammatical irregularities.
[15]To Koriun have been attributed the translations of the three apocryphal books of the Maccabees.
[16]Koriun book was the origin of the claim that the Georgian alphabet was created by Mashtots.
[17]
After the death of Mashtots, Koriun was tasked by Hovsep Hoghotsmetsi, one of the spiritual leaders at that time, to start writing Mesrop's biography.
[18]Now Koriun's work is known as "Varq Mashtotsi" (Life of Mashtots).
[19]Koriun finished Koriun's work before the Avarayr battle in 451 and new political developments in the region.
[20]In the modern period it was translated into Russian, English, French and German.
