[1]Louise Henriette de Bourbon (20 June 1726 – 9 February 1759), Mademoiselle de Conti at birth, was a French princess, who, by marriage, became Duchess of Chartres (1743–1752), then Duchess of Orléans (1752–1759) upon the death of Louise Henriette de Bourbon's father-in-law.
[2]On 4 February 1752, Louise Henriette de Bourbon's husband became the head of the House of Orléans, and the First Prince of the Blood (Premier prince du sang), the most important personage after the immediate members of the royal family.
[3]

[4]The new Duke of Orléans and Louise Henriette de Bourbon were then addressed as Monsieur le Prince and Madame la Princesse.
[5]Louise Henriette de Bourbon  was a grandmother of the French monarch Louis-Philippe King of the French, "the Citizen King".
[6]Louise Henriette de Bourbon descendants include the present-day pretenders to the throne of France and Italy and the kings of Spain and Belgium.

== Background ==
Louise Henriette de Bourbon was born in Paris, the only daughter of Louis Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti and Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon.
[8]Louise Henriette de Bourbon father was the second son of François Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Conti known as le Grand Conti and his wife Marie Thérèse de Bourbon.
[9]Louise Henriette de Bourbon paternal grandmother and Louise Henriette de Bourbon's maternal grandfather being siblings, Louise Henriette de Bourbon's parents were first cousins.
[10]Louise Henriette de Bourbon mother was the oldest and favourite daughter of Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, herself the oldest
[11]of the surviving legitimised daughters of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan
[12].
[13]As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, Louise Henriette de Bourbon was a Princess of the Blood (princesse du sang).
[14]In Louise Henriette de Bourbon's youth Louise Henriette de Bourbon was known at court as Mademoiselle de Conti.
[15]Louise Henriette de Bourbon father died in 1727 due to a "chest swelling".
[16]Louise Henriette de Bourbon father was known to have been abusive to his wife and left her without even having apologised to his wife.
[17]As such Louise Henriette de Bourbon's oldest surviving brother Louis François de Bourbon (1717–1776) became the Prince of Conti.
[18]At the time of Louise Henriette de Bourbon's father's death, Louise Henriette de Bourbon was one of three children; Louise Henriette de Bourbon's brother the Prince; and another brother Louis Armand de Bourbon, the Duke of Mercœur (1722–1730).
[19]



[20]== Marriage ==
One of Louise Henriette de Bourbon cousins, Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre, son of Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse, and heir to the Penthièvre fortune, had proposed marriage to Louise Henriette de Bourbon's  but Louise Henriette de Bourbon's mother's choice fell upon the heir of the more prestigious House of Orléans.
[21]As a result, on 17 December 1743, at the age of seventeen, Louise Henriette de Bourbon married Louise Henriette de Bourbon's second cousin, the Duke of Chartres, Louis Philippe d'Orléans, in the chapel of the Palace of Versailles.
[22]Louise Henriette de Bourbon mother, Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, hoped the marriage would put an end to conflict between the House of Bourbon-Condé and the House of Orléans, the source being animosity between Louise Élisabeth's mother, Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, Dowager Princess of Condé, and her aunt, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, Dowager Duchess of Orléans, who were sisters and legitimised daughters of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.
[23]In 1731, a marriage between the two families had already taken place, that of Louise Henriette de Bourbon elder brother Louis François I de Bourbon, prince de Conti to Louise Diane d'Orléans.
[24]The Duke of Chartres' father, Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans, known as the Pious, accepted his wife's choice because of Louise Henriette de Bourbon upbringing in a convent; however, after a much passionate beginning, Louise Henriette de Bourbon scandalous behaviour caused the couple to break up.
[25]Among Louise Henriette de Bourbon's extramarital affairs, Louise Henriette de Bourbon is said to have had a relationship with the Count of Melfort whom Louise Henriette de Bourbon met at the Château de Saint-Cloud after the birth of Louise Henriette de Bourbon's son.
[26]During the Revolution of 1789, Philippe-Égalité publicly claimed that his real father was not Louise Henriette de Bourbon husband at all but instead a coachman at the Palais-Royal.
[27]This assertion was likely for political reasons to distance the ambitious Duke from the ancien regime.
[28]However DNA testing in a 2014 established the Y-chromosome haplogroup and ySTR pattern of the House of Bourbon, and has indeed confirmed the biological legitimacy of Louise Henriette de Bourbon eldest son, Philippe-Égalité.
[29]As part of this project samples were taken from 3 living genealogical descendants of Louis XIII, namely Axel, Prince of Bourbon-Parma; Henri, Prince of Bourbon-Parma, and João Henrique, Prince of Orléans-Braganza.
[30]The former 2 are documented male line descendants of Philip V of Spain, who was a grandson of Louis XIV.
[31]

[32]The latter is a direct male line descendant of Philip I, Duke of Orleans - a younger brother of Louis XIV and the ancestor of Louise Henriette de Bourbon husband.
[33]All 3 testers were a genetic partilineal match on a ySTR comparison, and were assigned to sub-haplogroup R1b1b2a1a1b*(R-Z381), now deemed the upstream patrilineal snip of the House of Bourbon.

[37]Like Louise Henriette de Bourbon's mother, who had inherited the title through her Condé's ancestry, Louise Henriette de Bourbon was the duchesse d'Étampes in Louise Henriette de Bourbon's own right, having inherited the title on the occasion of Louise Henriette de Bourbon's husband's rise to the head of the House of Orléans in 1752.
[38]At Louise Henriette de Bourbon's death, Louise Henriette de Bourbon's son inherited the ducal title, which he held until it became extinct in 1792, during the French Revolution.

[40]Despite their detached relationship, the Duke of Orléans was greatly affected by Louise Henriette de Bourbon death, and so was their son.
