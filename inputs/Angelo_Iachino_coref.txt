[1]Angelo Iachino (or Jachino; April 24, 1889 – December 3, 1976) was an Italian admiral during World War II.
[2]


== Early life and career ==
Angelo Iachino was born in Sanremo, Liguria, in 1889, the son of Giuseppe Iachino, a middle school teacher, and Emilia Piccione.
[3]Angelo Iachino entered the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1904, and graduated in 1907.
[4]In 1911–1912 Angelo Iachino participated in the Italo-Turkish War with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant.
[5]

[6]During World War I Angelo Iachino first served on the battleship Giulio Cesare as a lieutenant and then, in July 1917, Angelo Iachino was given command of the torpedo boat 66 PN.
[7]In this role Angelo Iachino participated in several missions in the Adriatic, including, on 31 October 1918, the support to the Raid on Pula (66 PN was to tow near Pola one of the two MAS carrying Raffaele Rossetti, Raffaele Paolucci and their mignatta, but she was forced to abort due to engine problems).
[8]For Angelo Iachino's bravery in combat actions in the Northern Adriatic Angelo Iachino was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor in November 1918.
[9]
From 1923 to 1928 Angelo Iachino served in China as naval attache to the Italian embassy and commanding officer of the gunboat Ermanno Carlotto, stationed in Tianjin; during this period, in 1926, Angelo Iachino was promoted to commander.
[10]In 1928 Angelo Iachino assumed command of a destroyer, and later (after becoming captain in 1932) of the light cruiser Armando Diaz in the early 1930s, during a propaganda cruise abroad.
[11]In 1936 Angelo Iachino was promoted to Contrammiraglio and in 1938 to Ammiraglio di Divisione; during the Spanish Civil War Angelo Iachino was the commander of two groups of light ships.
[12]

[13]In April 1939, on board the light cruiser Giovanni delle Bande Nere, Angelo Iachino participated in the Italian invasion of Albania.
[14]In 1939 Angelo Iachino became Ammiraglio di Squadra.
[15]Angelo Iachino also commanded the Livorno Naval Academy for a period.
[16]


== World War II ==
In August 1940 Angelo Iachino was given command of the 2nd Naval Squadron (consisting of the 1st, 3rd and 7th Naval Divisions), with flag on the heavy cruiser Pola, after its previous commander, Admiral Riccardo Paladini, came down with angina pectoris.
[17]In this role, Angelo Iachino participated on 27 November 1940 in the Battle of Cape Spartivento.
[18]On 9 December 1940 Angelo Iachino replaced Admiral Inigo Campioni as commander of the entire battle fleet of the Regia Marina, with flag on the battleship Vittorio Veneto.
[19]

[20]On 9 February 1941, Angelo Iachino led the Italian fleet in the unsuccessful pursuit of the British Force H, after the latter had bombarded Genoa and La Spezia.
[21]Angelo Iachino again commanded the Italian battle fleet in the Battle of Cape Matapan (26-29 March 1941), which resulted in the biggest defeat ever suffered by the Regia Marina; dismissing reports of nearby British battleships as incorrect or exaggerated, Angelo Iachino sent the entire 1st Cruiser Division to the rescue of the stricken cruiser Pola, resulting in the annihilation of the entire division by the three battleships of Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham's Mediterranean Fleet.
[22]Angelo Iachino actions during this battle have been the subject of much criticism since then; despite this, Angelo Iachino wasn't relieved of command.
[23]

[24]In July and September 1941 Angelo Iachino led the fleet in fruitless attempts to intercept British convoys to Malta (Operation Substance and Operation Halberd).
[25]During the First Battle of Sirte (16 December 1941) and the Second Battle of Sirte (22 March 1942) the forces under Angelo Iachino's command clashed with the escorts of British convoys heading for Malta, but despite Angelo Iachino's superior strength Angelo Iachino – concerned about not underestimating the enemy forces (to the point of believing incorrect reports about nonexistent battleships) and avoiding night action, both of which had been Angelo Iachino's fatal mistakes at Matapan – did not press the attack and was unable to cause significant damage to the convoys, but were later sunk by Axis air attack.
[26]
Operation Vigorous (12-16 June 1942; known in Italy as the "Battle of Mid June") was instead Angelo Iachino's most important success; despite the losses caused by air and submarine attacks (the battleship Littorio was torpedoed, and the heavy cruiser Trento was sunk), Angelo Iachino kept advancing towards the British convoy sailing from Alexandria to Malta, eventually leading to it aborting its mission and turning back to port.
On 5 April 1943 Angelo Iachino was replaced by Admiral Carlo Bergamini as the commander of the Italian battle fleet.
[27]At the same time Angelo Iachino was promoted to Ammiraglio d'Armata.
[28]In 1945 Angelo Iachino was transferred to the reserve, but Angelo Iachino appealed against this and was restored to active service in 1948.
[29]Angelo Iachino finally left active service in 1954 and was discharged in 1962.
[30]

[31]During Angelo Iachino's later years Angelo Iachino wrote several books about Angelo Iachino's actions during the war, especially focusing on Matapan and trying to justify Angelo Iachino's actions in that battle.
[32]In 1974 Angelo Iachino donated the money for the construction of a Sailor's Monument in Taranto.
[33]Angelo Iachino died in Rome on 3 December 1976, at the age of 87.
