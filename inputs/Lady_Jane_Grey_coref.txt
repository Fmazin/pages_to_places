[1]Lady Jane Grey (c. 1537 – 12 February 1554), also known as Lady Jane Dudley after her marriage and as the "Nine Days' Queen", was an English noblewoman who claimed the throne of England and Ireland from 10 to 19 July 1553.
[2]

[3]Lady Jane Grey was the great-granddaughter of King Henry VII through his daughter, Mary Tudor, and was therefore a grandniece of King Henry VIII, and a first cousin once removed of Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I.
[4]Lady Jane Grey had an excellent humanist education, and a reputation as one of the most learned young women of Lady Jane Grey's day.
[5]In May 1553, Lady Jane Grey married Lord Guildford Dudley, a younger son of Edward VI's chief minister John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland.
[6]In June 1553, the dying Edward VI wrote his will, nominating Lady Jane Grey and Lady Jane Grey's male heirs as successors to the Crown, in part because his half-sister Mary was Catholic, while Lady Jane Grey was a committed Protestant and would support the reformed Church of England, whose foundation Edward laid.
[7]The will removed his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, from the line of succession on account of their illegitimacy, subverting their claims under the Third Succession Act.
[8]

[9]After Edward's death, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen on 10 July 1553, and awaited coronation in the Tower of London.
[10]Support for Mary grew quickly, and most of Lady Jane Grey supporters abandoned Lady Jane Grey's 
[11]The Privy Council of England suddenly changed sides, and proclaimed Mary as queen on 19 July 1553, deposing Lady Jane Grey 
[12]Lady Jane Grey primary supporter, Lady Jane Grey's father-in-law, the Duke of Northumberland, was accused of treason, and executed less than a month later.
[13]Lady Jane Grey was held prisoner in the Tower, and in November 1553 was also convicted of treason, which carried a sentence of death.
[14]
Mary initially spared Lady Jane Grey's life; however, Lady Jane Grey soon became viewed as a threat to the Crown when Lady Jane Grey's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, became involved with Wyatt's rebellion against Queen Mary's intention to marry Philip of Spain.
[15]Lady Jane Grey and Lady Jane Grey's husband were executed on 12 February 1554.
[16]At the time of Lady Jane Grey's execution, Lady Jane Grey was either 16 or 17 years old.
[17]



[18]== Early life and education ==
Lady Jane Grey was the eldest daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his wife, Frances Brandon.
[19]The traditional view is that Lady Jane Grey was born at Bradgate Park in Leicestershire in October 1537, while more recent research indicates that Lady Jane Grey was born somewhat earlier, possibly in London, sometime before May 1537 or between May 1536 and February 1537.
[20]This would coincide with the fact that Lady Jane Grey was noted as being in Lady Jane Grey's seventeenth year at the time of Lady Jane Grey's execution.
[21]Frances was the eldest daughter of Henry VIII's younger sister, Mary.
[22]Lady Jane Grey had two younger sisters: Lady Katherine and Lady Mary.
[23]Through their mother, the three sisters were great-granddaughters of Henry VII; great-nieces of Henry VIII; and first cousins once removed of the future Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I.
[24]

[25]Lady Jane Grey received a humanist education from John Aylmer, speaking Latin and Greek from an early age, also studying Hebrew with Aylmer, and Italian with Michelangelo Florio.
[26]Lady Jane Grey was particularly fond, throughout Lady Jane Grey's life, of writing letters in Latin and Greek.
[27]Through the influence of Lady Jane Grey's father and Lady Jane Grey's tutors, Lady Jane Grey became a committed Protestant and also corresponded with the Zürich reformer Heinrich Bullinger.
[28]

[29]Lady Jane Grey preferred academic studies rather than activities such as hunting parties and allegedly regarded Lady Jane Grey's strict upbringing, which was typical of the time, as harsh.
[30]To the visiting scholar Roger Ascham, who found Lady Jane Grey's reading Plato, Lady Jane Grey is said to have complained: 
For when Lady Jane Grey am in the presence either of father or mother, whether Lady Jane Grey speak, keep silence, sit, stand or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything else, Lady Jane Grey must do it as it were in such weight, measure and number, even so perfectly as God made the world; or else Lady Jane Grey am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with pinches, nips and bobs and other ways (which Lady Jane Grey will not name for the honour Lady Jane Grey bear them) ... that Lady Jane Grey think Lady Jane Grey in hell.
Around February 1547, Lady Jane Grey was sent to live in the household of Edward VI's uncle, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, who soon married Henry VIII's widow, Katherine Parr.
[31]After moving there, Lady Jane Grey was able to receive educational opportunities available in court circles.
[32]Lady Jane Grey lived with the couple at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire as an attendant to Katherine, until Katherine died in childbirth in September 1548.
[33]About eleven years old at the time, Lady Jane Grey was chief mourner at Katherine's funeral.
[34]After Thomas Seymour's arrest for treason, Lady Jane Grey returned to Bradgate and continued Lady Jane Grey's studies.

[38]Lady Jane Grey acted as chief mourner at Katherine Parr's funeral; Thomas Seymour showed continued interest to keep Lady Jane Grey's in his household, and Lady Jane Grey returned there for about two months before he was arrested at the end of 1548.
[39]Seymour's brother, the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, felt threatened by Thomas' popularity with the young King Edward.
[40]Among other things, Thomas Seymour was charged with proposing Lady Jane Grey as a bride for the king.
[41]In the course of Thomas Seymour's following attainder and execution, Lady Jane Grey father was lucky to stay largely out of trouble.
[42]After his fourth interrogation by the King's Council, he proposed Lady Jane Grey as a bride for the Protector's eldest son, Lord Hertford.
[43]Nothing came of this, however, and Lady Jane Grey was not engaged until 25 May 1553, Lady Jane Grey's bridegroom being Lord Guildford Dudley, a younger son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland.
[44]The Duke, Lord President of the King's Council from late 1549, was then the most powerful man in the country.
[45]On 25 May 1553, the couple were married at Durham House in a triple wedding, in which Lady Jane Grey sister Katherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Herbert, and another Katherine, Lord Guildford's sister, with Henry Hastings, the Earl of Huntingdon's heir.
[46]



[47]== Claim to the throne and accession ==

The Third Succession Act of 1544 restored Henry VIII's daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, to the line of succession, although they were still regarded as illegitimate.
[48]Furthermore, this Act authorised Henry VIII to alter the succession by his will.
[49]Henry's will reinforced the succession of his three children, and then declared that, should none of them leave descendants, the throne would pass to heirs of his younger sister, Mary, which included Lady Jane Grey 
[50]For reasons unknown, Henry excluded Lady Jane Grey mother, Frances Grey, from the succession, and also bypassed the claims of the descendants of his elder sister, Margaret, who had married into the Scottish royal house and nobility.
[51]

[52]Both Mary and Elizabeth had been named illegitimate by statute during the reign of Henry VIII after his marriages to Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn had been declared void.
[53]When the 15-year-old Edward VI lay dying in early summer 1553, his Catholic half-sister Mary was still his heir presumptive.
[54]Edward, in a draft will ("My devise for the Succession") composed earlier in 1553, had first restricted the succession to (non-existent) male descendants of Frances Brandon and her daughters, before he named Lady Jane Grey and Lady Jane Grey's heirs male" as his successors, probably in June 1553; the intent was to ensure his Protestant legacy, thereby bypassing Mary, a Roman Catholic.
[55]Edward's decision to name Lady Jane Grey Lady Jane Grey was possibly instigated by Northumberland.
[56]Edward VI personally supervised the copying of his will which was finally issued as letters patent on 21 June and signed by 102 notables, among them the whole Privy Council, peers, bishops, judges, and London aldermen.
[57]Edward also announced to have his "declaration" passed in parliament in September, and the necessary writs were prepared.
[58]

[59]The King died on 6 July 1553, but his death was not announced until four days later.
[60]On 9 July, Lady Jane Grey was informed that Lady Jane Grey was now queen, and according to Lady Jane Grey's own later claims, accepted the crown only with reluctance.
[61]On 10 July, Lady Jane Grey was officially proclaimed Queen of England, France and Ireland after Lady Jane Grey had taken up secure residence in the Tower of London, where English monarchs customarily resided from the time of accession until coronation.
[62]Lady Jane Grey refused to name Lady Jane Grey's husband Dudley as king, because that would require an Act of Parliament.
[63]Northumberland faced a number of key tasks to consolidate his power after Edward's death.
[64]Most importantly, he had to isolate and, ideally, capture Mary Tudor to prevent her from gathering support.
[65]As soon as Mary was sure of King Edward's demise, she left her residence at Hunsdon and set out to East Anglia, where she began to rally her supporters.
[66]Northumberland set out from London with troops on 14 July to capture Mary.
[67]The Privy Council switched their allegiance and proclaimed Mary queen in London, on 19 July.
[68]The historical consensus assumes that this was in recognition of overwhelming support of the population for Mary.
[69]However, there is no clear evidence for that outside Norfolk and Suffolk, where Northumberland had put down Kett's Rebellion, hence where princess Mary sought refuge.
[70]Rather, it seems that Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel—whom Northumberland had arrested and detained twice as an ally of Somerset, before rehabilitating him—engineered a coup d'état in the Privy Council in Northumberland's absence.
[71]

[72]Lady Jane Grey is often called the Nine-Day Queen, although if Lady Jane Grey's reign is dated from the moment of Edward's death on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey's reign could have been a few days longer.
[73]On 19 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was imprisoned in the Tower's Gentleman Gaoler's apartments, Lady Jane Grey's husband in the Beauchamp Tower.
[74]The Duke of Northumberland was executed on 22 August 1553.
[75]In September, Parliament declared Mary the rightful successor and denounced and revoked Lady Jane Grey proclamation as that of a usurper.
[76]



[77]== Trial and execution ==
Referred to by the court as Lady Jane Grey  Lady Jane Grey was charged with high treason, as were Lady Jane Grey's husband, two of his brothers, and the former archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer.
[78]Their trial, by a special commission, took place on 13 November 1553, at Guildhall in the City of London.
[79]The commission was chaired by Sir Thomas White, Lord Mayor of London, and Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk.
[80]Other members included Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, and John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath.
[81]As was to be expected, all defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death.
[82]Lady Jane Grey guilt, of having treacherously assumed the title and the power of the monarch, was evidenced by a number of documents Lady Jane Grey had signed as "Jane the Quene".
[83]Lady Jane Grey sentence was to "be burned alive on Tower Hill or beheaded as the Queen pleases" (burning was the traditional English punishment for treason committed by women).
[84]The imperial ambassador reported to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, that Lady Jane Grey's life was to be spared.
[85]

[86]Wyatt's rebellion in January 1554 against Queen Mary's marriage plans with Philip of Spain sealed Lady Jane Grey fate.
[87]Lady Jane Grey father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his two brothers joined the rebellion, and so the government decided to go through with the verdict against Lady Jane Grey and Guildford.
[88]Their execution was first scheduled for 9 February 1554, but was then postponed for three days to give Lady Jane Grey a chance to convert to the Catholic faith.
[89]Mary sent her chaplain John Feckenham to Lady Jane Grey 
[90]Though Lady Jane Grey would not give in to his efforts "to save Lady Jane Grey's soul", Lady Jane Grey became friends with him and allowed him to accompany Lady Jane Grey's to the scaffold.
[91]On the morning of 12 February 1554, the authorities took Guildford from his rooms at the Tower of London to the public execution place at Tower Hill, where he was beheaded.
[92]A horse and cart brought his remains back to the Tower, past the rooms where Lady Jane Grey was staying.
[93]Seeing Lady Jane Grey's husband's corpse return, Lady Jane Grey is reported to have exclaimed: "Oh, Guildford, Guildford."
[94]Lady Jane Grey was then taken out to Tower Green, inside the Tower, to be beheaded.
[95]According to the account of Lady Jane Grey's execution given in the anonymous Chronicle of Lady Jane Grey and of Two Years of Queen Mary, which formed the basis for Raphael Holinshed's depiction, Lady Jane Grey gave a speech upon ascending the scaffold:

Good people, Lady Jane Grey am come hither to die, and by a law Lady Jane Grey am condemned to the same.
[96]The fact, indeed, against the Queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by Lady Jane Grey  but touching the procurement and desire thereof by Lady Jane Grey or on Lady Jane Grey behalf, Lady Jane Grey do wash Lady Jane Grey hands thereof in innocency, before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day.
[97]

[98]While admitting to action considered unlawful, Lady Jane Grey declared that "Lady Jane Grey do wash Lady Jane Grey hands thereof in innocence".
[99]Lady Jane Grey then recited Psalm 51 (Have mercy upon Lady Jane Grey  O God) in English, and handed Lady Jane Grey's gloves and handkerchief to Lady Jane Grey's maid.
[100]The executioner asked Lady Jane Grey's for forgiveness, which Lady Jane Grey granted him, pleading: "Lady Jane Grey pray you dispatch Lady Jane Grey quickly."
[101]Referring to Lady Jane Grey's head, Lady Jane Grey asked, "Will you take it off before Lady Jane Grey lay Lady Jane Grey down?", and the axeman answered, "No, Lady Jane Grey "
[102]Lady Jane Grey then blindfolded Lady Jane Grey 
[103]Lady Jane Grey then failed to find the block with Lady Jane Grey's hands, and cried, "What shall Lady Jane Grey do?
[104]Where is it?"
[105]Probably Sir Thomas Brydges, the Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, helped Lady Jane Grey's find Lady Jane Grey's way.
[106]With Lady Jane Grey's head on the block, Lady Jane Grey spoke the last words of Jesus as recounted in the Gospel of Luke: "Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!"
[107]The axe then fell and Lady Jane Grey was beheaded in one clean stroke.
[108]


[109]Lady Jane Grey and Guildford are buried in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula on the north side of Tower Green.
[110]No memorial stone was erected at their grave.
[111]Lady Jane Grey father, the Duke of Suffolk, was executed 11 days after Lady Jane Grey  on 23 February 1554.
[112]Lady Jane Grey mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, married her Master of the Horse and chamberlain, Adrian Stokes, in March 1555.
[113]She was fully pardoned by Mary and allowed to live at Court with her two surviving daughters.
[114]She died in 1559.
[115]


== Legacy ==

In 1911, the British historian Albert Pollard called Lady Jane Grey "the traitor-heroine of the Reformation".
[116]During the Marian persecutions and its aftermath, Lady Jane Grey became viewed as a Protestant martyr, featuring prominently in the several editions of Foxe's Book of Martyrs (Actes and Monuments of these Latter and Perillous Dayes) by John Foxe.
[117]The story of Lady Jane Grey life grew to legendary proportions in popular culture, producing romantic biographies, novels, plays, operas, paintings, and films, such as Lady Jane in 1986.
