[9]=
Gustav Adolf von Götzen was born into a comital family at their main residence, Scharfeneck Castle, back then in the Kingdom of Prussia.
[10]In present-day Poland and now called Sarny Castle, the castle and the adjoining summer palace, as well as the castle chapel in which Gustav Adolf von Götzen may have been baptized, still exist despite decades of disrepair in the communist era.
[11]

[12]Gustav Adolf von Götzen studied law at the universities of Paris, Berlin and Kiel between 1884 and 1887.
[13]Gustav Adolf von Götzen then joined the army, and became (in 1887) a Lieutenant in the 2nd Garde-Ulanen regiment.
[14]Between 1890 and 1891 Gustav Adolf von Götzen was stationed in Rome  and it was from there that Gustav Adolf von Götzen made Gustav Adolf von Götzen's first African trip, in a hunting expedition to Mount Kilimanjaro.

[18]

[19]From 1885, Carl Peters had begun claiming areas of East Africa for Germany.
[20]The Tanganyikan coast proved relatively easy, but conquest of the inland areas of the colony - right up to the Belgian Congo - was more difficult as large parts were still unexplored.
[21]For this reason, Gustav Adolf von Götzen led an expedition to claim these hinterlands.
[22]Gustav Adolf von Götzen took with Gustav Adolf von Götzen Georg von Prittwitz and Hermann Kersting.
[23]

[24]The group set off from Pangani, on the Tanganyikan coast, on 21 December 1893.
[25]After travelling through Maasai areas, they eventually arrived, on 2 May 1894, at Rusumo Falls on the Kagera river.
[26]By crossing the river, the group entered in the Kingdom of Rwanda, at the time, it was one of the most organised and centralised kingdoms in the region.
[27]Gustav Adolf von Götzen became the second European to set foot in Rwanda since Oscar Baumann's 1892 expedition.
[28]Gustav Adolf von Götzen group travelled right through Rwanda, meeting the mwami (king) Kigeli IV Rwabugili at his palace in Kageyo, and eventually reaching Lake Kivu, the western edge of the kingdom.
[29]

[30]After encountering and climbing some of the Virunga Mountains, Gustav Adolf von Götzen decided to continue west through the Congolese jungle.
[31]With great effort, they managed to reach the Congo river  on 21 September, which they then followed downstream, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean on 29 November.
[32]In January 1895, Gustav Adolf von Götzen returned to Germany.
[33]


=== Service in America: 1896 - 1901 ===
Between 1896 and 1898 Gustav Adolf von Götzen worked as an attaché in Washington, D.C., and Gustav Adolf von Götzen served as an observer with Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish–American War.
[34]While Gustav Adolf von Götzen was there, Gustav Adolf von Götzen fell in love with the American widow of William Matthews Lay (1845-1893), May Loney (1857-1931), and married her.
[35]They had a daughter, Wanda Luise von Götzen, in 1898.
[36] Afterwards, Gustav Adolf von Götzen joined the general staff of the army in Berlin, where Gustav Adolf von Götzen was promoted in 1900 to the rank of Captain.
[37]


=== German East Africa and Maji Maji Rebellion: 1901-1906 ===
Due to Gustav Adolf von Götzen's knowledge of local conditions, Gustav Adolf von Götzen was appointed governor of German East Africa in March 1901.
[38]There had already been rebellions by the native population in the 1880s and 1890s, and in 1905 Gustav Adolf von Götzen was faced with outbreak of the Maji Maji Rebellion, which quickly took over about half of the colony.
[39]This was similar in severity to the Herero Wars taking place in German South-West Africa, but was noticed less by the German public.
[40]Gustav Adolf von Götzen sent for reinforcements, and suppressed the rebellion by force.
[41]Gustav Adolf von Götzen troops lost 15 Europeans and 389 African soldiers, according to official data.
[42]Estimates of the numbers of Africans who died in the famine following the uprising range from 75,000, to 100-120,000, to 300,000, depending on the source consulted.
[43]On the 14th of June 1906, Gustav Adolf von Götzen later returned to Germany after submitting a report to the Foreign Office outlining what Gustav Adolf von Götzen believed were the causes of the Maji Maji Rebellion.
[44]The Foreign Office, keen to avoid a colonial scandal, accepted Gustav Adolf von Götzen report, and Gustav Adolf von Götzen retired ostensibly on the grounds of ill health.
[45]Following Gustav Adolf von Götzen's retirement, the German government began to administer its overseas possessions under civilian control.

[48]Later life ==
Gustav Adolf von Götzen diplomatic career was almost at an end after Gustav Adolf von Götzen's work as Governor.
[49]In early 1907 Gustav Adolf von Götzen was offered the minor post of a German envoy to Hamburg in which Gustav Adolf von Götzen's duties would involve mostly accompanying the Kaiser through the city.
[50]This lighter amount of work gave Gustav Adolf von Götzen the opportunity to publish a book DEUTSCH-OSTAFRIKA IM AUFSTAND, 1905-1906.
[51]In it, Gustav Adolf von Götzen attempted to justify Gustav Adolf von Götzen's involvement in the Maji Maji Rebellion and the causes that prompted Gustav Adolf von Götzen's response to quell the rebellion.
[52]This work was later published in 1909.
[53]Gustav Adolf von Götzen still took an interest in the colonial politics of the German Empire; Gustav Adolf von Götzen was an active member of the committee for the German Colonial Society until Gustav Adolf von Götzen's death on December 1, 1910 in a hospital in Schöneberg near Berlin.
[54]Gustav Adolf von Götzen wife outlived Gustav Adolf von Götzen by over two decades.
[55]They were buried together at the Ohlsdorfer Cemetery in Hamburg.
[56]


== Legacy ==
The German passenger ship Graf von Götzen was named after Gustav Adolf von Götzen and used as part of Germany's war effort on Lake Tanganyika in World War I.
[57]She was scuttled in July 1916 off the mouth of the Malagarasi River to prevent her falling into the hands of the Belgian troops.
[58]In 1924 on instructions from Winston Churchill, salvage operations by the Royal Navy succeeded in refloating the ship and in 1927 she returned to service as the M.V. Liemba  and is still running today as a passenger cargo ferry.
