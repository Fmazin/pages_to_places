[1]Johannes Leo Africanus (born al-Hasan Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi, Arabic: الحسن محمد الوزان الفاسي; c. 1494 – c.
[2] 1554)
[3]was an Andalusi diplomat and author who is best known for Leo Africanus's 1526 book Cosmographia et geographia de Affrica, later published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio as Descrittione dell'Africa (Description of Africa) in 1550, centered on the geography of the Maghreb and Nile Valley.
[4]The book was regarded among Leo Africanus's scholarly peers in Europe as the most authoritative treatise on the subject until the modern exploration of Africa.
[5]For this work, Leo Africanus became a household name among European geographers.
[6]Leo Africanus converted from Islam to Christianity and changed Leo Africanus's name to Johannes Leo de Medicis (يوحنا الأسد).

== Biography ==
Most of what is known about Leo Africanus's life is gathered from autobiographical notes in Leo Africanus's own work.
[8]Leo Africanus was born as al-Hasan, son of Muhammad in Granada around the year 1494.
[9]The year of birth can be estimated from Leo Africanus's self-reported age at the time of various historical events.
[10]Leo Africanus family moved to Fez soon after Leo Africanus's birth.
[11]In Fez Leo Africanus studied at the University of al-Qarawiyyin (also spelled al-Karaouine).
[12]As a young man Leo Africanus accompanied an uncle on a diplomatic mission, reaching as far as the city of Timbuktu (c. 1510), then part of the Songhai Empire.
[13]In 1517 when returning from a diplomatic mission to Constantinople on behalf of the Sultan of Fez Muhammad II Leo Africanus found Leo Africanus in the port of Rosetta during the Ottoman conquest of Egypt.
[14]Leo Africanus continued with Leo Africanus's journey through Cairo and Aswan and across the Red Sea to Arabia, where Leo Africanus probably performed a pilgrimage to Mecca.
[15]

On Leo Africanus's way back to Tunis in 1518 Leo Africanus was captured by Spanish corsairs either near the island of Djerba or more probably near Crete, and imprisoned on the island of Rhodes, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller.
[16]The usual fate of unransomed Muslim captives was slavery in Christian galleys, but when Leo Africanus's captors realized Leo Africanus's intelligence and importance, Leo Africanus was moved to the Castel Sant'Angeloin Rome and presented to Pope Leo X.
[17]Leo Africanus was soon freed and given a pension to persuade Leo Africanus to stay.
[18]Leo Africanus was baptized in the Basilica of Saint Peter's in 1520.
[19]Leo Africanus took the Latin name Johannes Leo de Medicis (Giovanni Leone in Italian).
[20]In Arabic, Leo Africanus preferred to translate this name as Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati (literally means John the Lion of Granada).
[21]It is likely that Leo Africanus was welcomed to the papal court as the Pope feared that Turkish forces might invade Sicily and southern Italy, and a willing collaborator could provide useful information on North Africa.
[22]Leo Africanus left Rome and spent the next three or four years traveling in Italy.
[23]The death of Leo Africanus's patron Leo X in 1521, and suspicions from the new Pope Adrian VI against a Muslim in court, was likely the reason for Leo Africanus's leaving Rome.
[24]While staying in Bologna Leo Africanus wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical vocabulary, of which only the Arabic part has survived, and a grammar of Arabic of which only an eight-page fragment has survived.
[25]Leo Africanus returned to Rome in 1526 under the protection of the new Pope Clement VII, a cousin of Leo X who replaced Adrian.
[26]According to Leo Africanus  Leo Africanus completed Leo Africanus's manuscript on African geography in the same year.
[27]The work was published in Italian with the title Della descrittione dell'Africa et delle cose notabili che ivi sono, per Giovan Lioni Africano in 1550 by the Venetian publisher Giovanni Battista Ramusio.
[28]The book proved to be extremely popular and was reprinted five times.
[29]It was also translated into other languages.
[30]French and Latin editions were published in 1556 while an English version was published in 1600 with the title A Geographical Historie of Africa.
[31]The Latin edition, which contained many errors and mistranslations, was used as the source for the English translation.
[32]

[33]There are several theories of Leo Africanus's later life, but none of them are certain.
[34]According to one theory, Leo Africanus spent it in Rome until Leo Africanus died around 1550, the year Description of Africa was published.
[35]This theory was based on indirect allusion in a later preface to this book.
[36]According to another theory, Leo Africanus left shortly before the Sack of Rome by Charles V's troops in 1527.
[37]Leo Africanus then returned to North Africa and lived in Tunis until Leo Africanus's death, some time after 1550.
[38]This was based on records by German orientalist Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter, who arrived in Italy and planned (but ultimately failed) to travel to Tunis to meet Leo Africanus 
[39]Yet another theory said that Leo Africanus left Tunis after it was captured by Charles V in 1535 for Morocco, Leo Africanus's second home country after Granada where Leo Africanus's relatives were still living.
[40]This was based on the assumption that Leo Africanus  having left Granada, would not have wanted to live under Christian Spanish rule again, and Leo Africanus's wish (recorded in Description of Africa) that Leo Africanus wanted to ultimately return to Leo Africanus's home country "by God's assistance".
[41]


=== Veracity of Africa trip ===

[42]It is unlikely that Leo Africanus visited all the places that Leo Africanus describes and Leo Africanus must therefore have relied on information obtained from other travellers.
[43]It is doubtful whether Leo Africanus visited Hausaland and Bornu and it is even possible that Leo Africanus never crossed the Sahara but relied on information from other travellers that Leo Africanus met in Morocco.
[44]The historian Pekka Masonen has argued that the belief of Leo Africanus's further travels was based on misreadings by modern scholars who interpreted Leo Africanus's book as an itinerary.
[45]At the time Leo Africanus visited the city of Timbuktu, it was a thriving Islamic city famous for its learning.
[46]Home to many scholars and learned men, Timbuktu also possessed a Great Mosque, renowned for its expansive library.
[47]The town was to become a byword in Europe as the most inaccessible of cities.
[48]At the time of Leo Africanus journey there, it was the centre of a busy trade carried on by traders in African products, gold, printed cottons, slaves and in Islamic books.
[49]


== Name ==

[50]In an autograph in one of Leo Africanus's surviving manuscripts, a fragment of an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical vocabulary Leo Africanus wrote for the Jewish physician Jacob Mantino, Leo Africanus signed Leo Africanus's name in Arabic as Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati (literally means John the Lion of Granada), a translation of Leo Africanus's Christian name, John-Leo, or Johannes Leo (Latin), or Giovanni Leone (Italian).
[51]Leo Africanus was also given the family name Medici after Leo Africanus's patron, Pope Leo X's family.
[52]The same manuscript also contained Leo Africanus's original name al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi.
[53]al-Hasan ibn Muhammad was a patronymic name meaning "al-Hasan, son of Muhammad", and al-Fasi is the Arabic demonym for someone from Fez, Morocco.

[55]== Works ==

Cosmographia et geographia de Affrica, later published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio as Description of Africa in 1550, is Leo Africanus most famous work.
[56]Leo Africanus wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical vocabulary for the Jewish physician Jacob Mantino.
[57]Leo Africanus also wrote an Arabic translation of the Epistles of St. Paul, which is dated in January 1521; the manuscript belongs to the Biblioteca Estense in Modena.
[58]Another surviving work is a biographical encyclopedia of 25 major Islamic scholars and 5 major Jewish scholars which was completed in Rome before Leo Africanus left the city in 1527 and published for the first time in Latin by Johann Heinrich Hottinger in 1664.
[59]Unlike Description of Africa, this biographical work was hardly noticed in Europe; the book contains various erroneous information, likely due to Leo Africanus's lack of sources when Leo Africanus was in Italy, forcing Leo Africanus to rely on memory.
[60]In Description of Africa, Leo Africanus referred to plans to write other books.
[61]Leo Africanus planned two descriptions of places, one for the Middle East and another for Europe.
[62]Leo Africanus also planned to write an exposition of the Islamic faith and a history of North Africa.
[63]None of these books survived nor has there been any proof that Leo Africanus completed them, which might have been due to Leo Africanus's possible return to North Africa.
