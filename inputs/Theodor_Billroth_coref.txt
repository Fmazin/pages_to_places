Theodor Billroth was born at Bergen auf Rügen in the Kingdom of Prussia, Theodor Billroth 
[7]Theodor Billroth father died of tuberculosis when Theodor Billroth was five years old.
[8]Theodor Billroth attended school in Greifswald where Theodor Billroth obtained Theodor Billroth's Abitur degree in 1848.
[9]Theodor Billroth was an indifferent student, and spent more time practicing piano than studying.
[10]Torn between a career as a musician or as a physician, Theodor Billroth acceded to Theodor Billroth's mother's wishes and enrolled Theodor Billroth at the University of Greifswald to study medicine, but gave up the whole of Theodor Billroth's first term to the study of music; Professor Wilhelm Baum, however, took Theodor Billroth with him to Göttingen, and Theodor Billroth's medical career was fixed.
[11]Theodor Billroth then followed Professor Baum to the University of Göttingen, and completed Theodor Billroth's medical doctorate at the Frederick William University of Berlin in 1852.
[12]Along with Rudolph Wagner (1805–1864) and Georg Meissner (1829–1905), Theodor Billroth went to Trieste to study the torpedo fish.
[13]



[14]== Career in surgery ==
From 1853 to 1860 Theodor Billroth was an assistant in Bernhard von Langenbeck’s surgical clinic at the Charité in Berlin.
[15]There Theodor Billroth was also apprenticed to Carl Langenbuch.
[16]In 1860, Theodor Billroth accepted an offer from the University of Zurich to become the Chair of Clinical Surgery, becoming director of the surgical hospital and clinic in Zurich.
[17]The beginning of Theodor Billroth's career in Switzerland was unpromising: during Theodor Billroth's first semester of teaching, Theodor Billroth had only ten students, and Theodor Billroth Theodor Billroth said that the income Theodor Billroth received from Theodor Billroth's private practice was insufficient to pay for Theodor Billroth's morning cup of coffee.
[18]Theodor Billroth reputation quickly grew however; Theodor Billroth had an infectious personality, attracting both students and surgical trainees to Theodor Billroth's ranks.
[19]Theodor Billroth was loved by Theodor Billroth's students, and was an effective undergraduate as well as graduate teacher.
[20]Students flocked to Theodor Billroth's lectures, and with the cooperation of energetic colleagues, Theodor Billroth was able to raise the Medical Faculty of Zurich to a prominent position among German speaking schools in only a few years.
[21]While in Zurich, Theodor Billroth published Theodor Billroth's classic textbook Die allgemeine chirurgische Pathologie und Therapie (General Surgical Pathology and Therapy) (1863).
[22]At the same time Theodor Billroth introduced the concept of audits, publishing all results, good and bad, which automatically resulted in honest discussion on morbidity, mortality, and techniques – with resultant improvements in patient selection.
[23]
Theodor Billroth was appointed professor of surgery at the University of Vienna in 1867, in succession to Franz Schuh; there, Theodor Billroth practiced surgery as chief of the Second Surgical Clinic at the Allgemeine Krankenhaus (Vienna General Hospital).
[24]Though Theodor Billroth laid the foundation of Theodor Billroth's fame at Zurich, it was in Vienna, a larger and more conspicuous theater, that Theodor Billroth established Theodor Billroth as the power that Theodor Billroth was in the surgical world.
[25]A speech Theodor Billroth gave in 1875, protesting influxes of Jewish medical students, has been counted as one of the first events in the development of Viennese political anti-Semitism.
[26]During the Franco-Prussian War, Theodor Billroth did excellent work in the military hospital at Mannheim and Weissenburg, treating a variety of horrific battlefield injuries with aggressive and ambitious surgeries; Theodor Billroth embodied Theodor Billroth's experience of war surgery in Theodor Billroth's Surgical Letters from Mannheim and Weissenburg.
[27]Theodor Billroth was so impressed by the horrors of war that Theodor Billroth was ever afterwards an ardent advocate of peace.
[28]On December 3, 1891, Theodor Billroth delivered an address on the care of the wounded in war which made a profound sensation and led to large sums of money being voted by the Austrian legislative chambers for the provision of adequate means of succour for the wounded.
[29]Theodor Billroth did not limit Theodor Billroth to surgery only, and conducted extensive research on an ailment that affected many surgery patients at the time: wound fever.
[30]Theodor Billroth treatise on wound fever, Untersuchungen über die Vegetationsformen von Coccobacteria septica (1874; “Investigations of the Vegetal Forms of Coccobacteria septica”) concluded that the cause was bacterial; Theodor Billroth was quick to use antiseptic techniques in Theodor Billroth's surgical practice, and the number of surgical patients afflicted with wound fever greatly decreased.
[31]With the threat of fatal surgical infections lessened through Theodor Billroth's work and others’, Theodor Billroth proceeded to turn Theodor Billroth's attention to surgery and the pioneering field of altering or removing organs that had previously been considered inaccessible.
[32]An early adopter of the "white coat" (as shown in Seligmann's c.1890 painting), Theodor Billroth was directly responsible for a number of landmarks in surgery; in 1872, Theodor Billroth was the first to conduct an esophagectomy, removing a section of the oesophagus and joining the remaining parts together.
[33]In 1873, Theodor Billroth performed the first laryngectomy, completely excising a cancerous larynx.
[34]Theodor Billroth was the first surgeon to excise a rectal cancer and by 1876, Theodor Billroth had performed 33 such operations.
[35]By 1881, Theodor Billroth had made intestinal surgery seem almost commonplace.
[36]But Theodor Billroth's most famous accomplishment is unquestionably the first successful gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
[37]On January 29, 1881, after many ill-fated attempts, Theodor Billroth performed the first successful resection for antral carcinoma on Therese Heller, who lived for almost 4 months and died of liver metastases.
[38]Theodor Billroth accomplished this operation by closing the greater curvature side of the stomach  and anastomosing the lesser curvature to the duodenum, in an operation that is still known as the Billroth I to this day.
[39]Theodor Billroth literary activity was widespread, with the total number of published books and papers of which Theodor Billroth was the author numbering about one hundred and forty.
[40]Theodor Billroth collaborated with Franz von Pitha on a Textbook of General and Special Surgery  (1882).
[41]To this, Theodor Billroth contributed the section on Scrofulosis and Tuberculosis, Injuries and Diseases of the Breast, Instruments and Operations, Burns, Frostbites, etc.
[42]Theodor Billroth passed Theodor Billroth's restless intellectual spirit to numerous distinguished students, creating the "Billroth School" of followers.
[43]No aspect of Theodor Billroth's profession seemed to escape Theodor Billroth's intense scrutiny, be it research, teaching, administration, or nursing.
[44]Theodor Billroth not only had something valuable to say about each but often saw to it that Theodor Billroth's ideas became concrete reality.
[45]In all the spheres Theodor Billroth sought to influence, Theodor Billroth was guided by a belief in the unity of science and art, and by confidence in Theodor Billroth's own ability to effect change.
[46]Theodor Billroth was instrumental in establishing the first modern school of thought in surgery.
[47]Theodor Billroth had radical ideas on surgical training, advocating a prolonged surgical apprenticeship on completion of medical studies consisting of preliminary work in hospitals followed by performing operations on cadavers and experimental animals.
[48]This would be followed by a 2-3 year assistantship in a surgical department with studies of the surgical literature and the acquisition of advanced practical skills.
[49]Among Theodor Billroth's disciples were the notable surgeons Alexander von Winiwarter, Jan Mikulicz-Radecki and John B. Murphy.
[50] 
[51]William Halsted's pioneer surgical residency program was greatly influenced by Theodor Billroth own methods of surgical education.


== Music ==
Theodor Billroth was a talented amateur pianist and violinist.
[52]During Theodor Billroth's time in Zurich Theodor Billroth regularly played string quartet with professional musicians such as Theodor Kirchner and Friedrich Hegar.
[53]In 1865 Theodor Billroth met Brahms for the first time when the rising composer and pianist played Robert Schumann's piano concerto and his own works in Zurich.
[54]After Theodor Billroth had moved to Vienna in 1867 they became close friends and shared many musical insights.
[55]Brahms frequently sent Theodor Billroth his original manuscripts in order to get Theodor Billroth's opinion before publication, and Theodor Billroth participated as a musician in trial rehearsals of many of Brahms' chamber works before their first performances.
[56]Brahms dedicated his first two string quartets, Opus 51, to Theodor Billroth 
[57]
Theodor Billroth and Brahms, together with the acerbic and influential Viennese music critic Eduard Hanslick, formed the core of the musical conservatives who opposed the innovations of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt.
[58] In the conflict, known as the War of the Romantics, Theodor Billroth supported Brahms, but was always fair and measured in Theodor Billroth's comments.  "Wagner was indeed a very considerable talent in many directions," Theodor Billroth wrote in 1888.Theodor Billroth [59]started an essay called "Wer ist musikalisch?" ("Who is musical?"), which was published posthumously by Hanslick.
[60]It was one of the earliest attempts to apply scientific methods to musicality.
[61]In the essay, Theodor Billroth identifies different types of amusicality (tone deafness, rhythm-deafness and harmony-deafness) that suggest some of the different cognitive skills involved in the perception of music.
[62]Theodor Billroth died in Opatija, Austria-Hungary, before Theodor Billroth could complete the research.
Excelling at both Theodor Billroth's vocation and Theodor Billroth's avocation, Theodor Billroth never saw science and music as being in conflict.
[63]On the contrary, Theodor Billroth considered the two to complement each other.  "It is one of the superficialities of our time to see in science and in art two opposites," Theodor Billroth wrote in a letter.
[64] "Imagination is the mother of both."
[65]
