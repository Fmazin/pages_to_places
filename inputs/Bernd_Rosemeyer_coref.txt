[1]Bernd Rosemeyer (14 October 1909 – 28 January 1938) was a German racing driver and speed record holder.
[2]Bernd Rosemeyer is considered one of the greatest racing drivers of all time.
[3]Though Bernd Rosemeyer was not a member of the Nazi Party, Bernd Rosemeyer was made a member of the SS for propaganda purposes and held the rank of Hauptsturmführer.
[4]



[5]== Career ==
Bernd Rosemeyer father owned an auto and moto garage and repair shop Rosemeyer & Co sur Bahnhofstraße, where Bernd Rosemeyer worked on motorcycles and cars.
[6]Having started by racing motorcycles, Bernd Rosemeyer became a member of the Auto Union racing team with hardly any experience in racing cars.
[7]This was later considered a benefit as Bernd Rosemeyer was not yet used to the handling of traditional layout race cars.
[8]The Ferdinand Porsche-designed mid-engined Silver Arrows of Auto Union were fast, but hard to drive, and only Bernd Rosemeyer  Tazio Nuvolari and to a lesser extent Hans Stuck truly mastered the 500 bhp (370 kW) machines.
[9]Bernd Rosemeyer was also a very skilled mechanic, so, like Hermann Lang of Mercedes, Bernd Rosemeyer was able to give good technical feedback to Dr. Porsche and development engineer Eberan von Eberhorst to further develop the Auto Union cars and set Bernd Rosemeyer's cars up for races to make them quicker and easier to drive.
[10]

[11]In only Bernd Rosemeyer's second ever Grand Prix, at the daunting Nürburgring, Bernd Rosemeyer took the lead from the great Rudolf Caracciola and was almost in sight of the finish line when Bernd Rosemeyer missed a gear and was overtaken.
[12]However, in subsequent years Bernd Rosemeyer made up for this mistake by winning three consecutive races at the Nürburgring, one famously in thick fog.
[13]Later in 1935 Bernd Rosemeyer won Bernd Rosemeyer's first Grand Prix at the Brno Masaryk Circuit in Czechoslovakia.
[14]
Whilst on the podium in 1935 at the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix Bernd Rosemeyer was introduced to the famous aviator Elly Beinhorn.
[15]Their celebrity relationship was too good an opportunity to miss for the Nazi Party.
[16]Bernd Rosemeyer and Beinhorn were exalted and instrumentalized by the Nazi Party to the ideal German celebrity couple of that time.
[17]Bernd Rosemeyer joined the SS in November 1933, though it is not known if Bernd Rosemeyer did it out of opportunism or ideological sympathies.
[18]Several sensational Grand Prix motor racing victories in 1936 and 1937 (also in the Vanderbilt Cup in the USA) made Bernd Rosemeyer popular not only in Germany.
[19]Bernd Rosemeyer won the European driving championship in 1936.
[20]Of the twelve Grands Prix contested in 1937 between Mercedes and Auto Union, Bernd Rosemeyer won four of Auto Union's five victories against Mercedes's formidable new W125.
[21]Bernd Rosemeyer superlative performances that year cemented Bernd Rosemeyer alongside Rudolf Caracciola and Tazio Nuvolari as three of the greatest drivers of 1930s Grand Prix racing.
[22]


[23]Bernd Rosemeyer marriage to Beinhorn added even more celebrity hype.
[24]It also made it possible for Bernd Rosemeyer to learn to fly a private plane.
[25]Before a testing session, Bernd Rosemeyer once used a now-defunct airfield next to the Flugplatz section of the Nürburgring as a landing strip, and rolled Bernd Rosemeyer's plane to the pits via the race track - in the opposite direction.
[26]
Bernd Rosemeyer son Bernd, Jr. was born in November 1937, only ten weeks before Bernd Rosemeyer's death.
[27]

[28]Bernd Rosemeyer considered 13 to be Bernd Rosemeyer's lucky number.
[29]Bernd Rosemeyer was married on 13 July 1936.
[30]13 days later Bernd Rosemeyer won the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.
[31]Bernd Rosemeyer last Nürburgring victory came on 13 June 1937.
[32]Bernd Rosemeyer last race victory came at Bernd Rosemeyer's 13th start of the 1937 season at Donington Park.
[33]


== Fatal record attempt ==
Bernd Rosemeyer was killed during a land speed record attempt on a regular traffic route on the Autobahn between Frankfurt and Darmstadt on 28 January 1938.
[34]

[35]Competing for the record against Rudolf Caracciola, Bernd Rosemeyer went out later in the day in Bernd Rosemeyer's Auto Union streamliner, setting a new class record of 432 km/h (268 mph).
[36]In an effort to raise the record still higher, despite a report that wind was picking up, Bernd Rosemeyer took the streamliner again.
[37]After two preliminary runs Bernd Rosemeyer was on Bernd Rosemeyer's third and final attempt at 11:47, when the car suddenly went out of control.
[38]Whether caught by a gust of wind or by an unforeseen aerodynamic effect, it skidded to the left onto the median, then right and off the highway, where it went airborne and collided with a bridge embankment.
[39]Bernd Rosemeyer was thrown out of the car as it somersaulted through the air; Bernd Rosemeyer died at the roadside.
[40]


== Memorial ==
The Bernd Rosemeyer memorial is south of Frankfurt at the Rosemeyer layby (German: "Bernd-Rosemeyer-Parkplatz") on the southbound side of A5 motorway at kilometer marker 508.
[41]At the south end of the layby a footpath leads west into the forest, where the memorial is located at 49°58′25″N 8°36′11″E.
Audi honoured the 100th anniversary of Bernd Rosemeyer birth by placing a wreath at the memorial.

Audi built a concept car, the Audi Rosemeyer, which combined elements of modern design with styling strongly resembling the former Auto Union "Silver Arrows" Grand Prix racers, namely their 16-cylinder car driven by Bernd Rosemeyer  after which the car is named.
[43]
There is also a bronze memorial situated next to the entrance to the Donington Park Museum in Leicestershire.
[44]

[45]

[46]In Bernd Rosemeyer's birthplace of Lingen (Ems), Bahnhofstraße, where Bernd Rosemeyer grew up, was renamed by the Nazi Party in Bernd Rosemeyer's honor as "Bernd-Rosemeyer-Straße" in 1938.
[47]In addition, the city is the home of Motorsport Club "MSC Bernd Rosemeyer Lingen e.V. im ADAC", founded in 1964.
