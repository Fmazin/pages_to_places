[1]Sisowath Sirik Matak (Khmer: ស៊ីសុវត្ថិ សិរិមតៈ; 22 January 1914 – 21 April 1975) was a Cambodian politician and member of the Cambodian royal family, under the House of Sisowath.

[2]Sisowath Sirik Matak was mainly notable for Sisowath Sirik Matak's involvement in Cambodian politics, particularly for Sisowath Sirik Matak's involvement in the 1970 change in power against Sisowath Sirik Matak's cousin, then Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and for Sisowath Sirik Matak's subsequent establishment, along with Lon Nol, of the Khmer Republic.



[3]== Early life ==
Sisowath Sirik Matak was born in Phnom Penh, and was a member of the Sisowath family, being the great-grandson of Sisowath of Cambodia by Sisowath Sirik Matak's grandfather Sisowath Essaravong and Sisowath Sirik Matak's father Sisowath Rathary.
[4]Sisowath Sirik Matak was recruited into the colonial civil service in 1930.

[5]Under the colonial French-imposed constitution, any member of the Norodom or Sisowath branches of the family could be selected as king, and Sisowath Sirik Matak was therefore one of the possible contenders to the Cambodian throne.
[6]In 1941, after the death of King Sisowath Monivong, the French authorities selected Sisowath Sirik Matak cousin Norodom Sihanouk to be King, believing him to be relatively pliant.
[7]Sihanouk later accused Sisowath Sirik Matak of harbouring a deep resentment against him, stating that Sisowath Sirik Matak "hated me from childhood days because Sisowath Sirik Matak thought Sisowath Sirik Matak's uncle, Prince Sisowath Monireth, should have been placed on the throne instead of myself.
[8]Sisowath Sirik Matak even had a notion that Sisowath Sirik Matak Sisowath Sirik Matak should have been chosen".



[9]== Political career ==
After the Second World War, Sisowath Sirik Matak became increasingly involved in Cambodian politics.
[10]As a part of the right-wing Khmer Renovation party headed by Lon Nol, Sisowath Sirik Matak took part in the National Assembly elections in 1947, though the party failed to win any seats.
[11]Sihanouk, then acting as Prime Minister, placed Sisowath Sirik Matak in charge of defence in 1952, formally appointing Sisowath Sirik Matak Minister of Defence in the interim government set up after independence in 1954; Sihanouk's Sangkum movement absorbed the Khmer Renovation Party prior to the Sangkum victory in the 1955 elections.

[12]Despite the incorporation of much of the right-wing opposition into the Sangkum, Sisowath Sirik Matak remained an implacable opponent of Sihanouk, and especially of the latter's toleration of North Vietnamese activity within Cambodia's borders.
[13]Throughout the 1960s, Sihanouk attempted to minimize Sisowath Sirik Matak leverage on domestic politics by successively appointing Sisowath Sirik Matak as Ambassador to China (1962–1964), the Philippines, and Japan.



[14]=== Cambodian coup of 1970 ===

Sisowath Sirik Matak power increased substantially after Lon Nol became prime minister in August 1969.
[15]After being appointed as Lon Nol's deputy, Sisowath Sirik Matak proceeded to organise a series of economic denationalisation and deregulation measures in opposition to Sihanouk's previous policy of state control of import and export, banking, and production of pharmaceuticals and alcohol.
[16]Sisowath Sirik Matak even visited Hanoi secretly to find out what could be done to remove Vietnamese troops from Cambodian soil.
[17]Sisowath Sirik Matak was infuriated when Sisowath Sirik Matak was shown documents signed by Sihanouk agreeing to the establishment of Vietnamese bases and the transport of Vietnamese supplies through Cambodian ports.
[18]On 12 March 1970, while Sihanouk was on a trip abroad, Sisowath Sirik Matak canceled Sihanouk's trade agreements and Lon Nol demanded that all North Vietnamese and NLF troops leave Cambodia by dawn on March 15.
[19]The deadline passed without any response from the Vietnamese.
[20]On 18 March, Sisowath Sirik Matak assisted Lon Nol in organising a vote of the National Assembly to depose Sihanouk as head of state.
[21]The pretext was given by a series of anti-Vietnamese riots – likely encouraged by the Prime Minister and Sisowath Sirik Matak – in front of the North Vietnamese embassy.
[22]Foreign media subsequently suggested that Sisowath Sirik Matak  was the real organisational force behind the coup; it was claimed that in order to finally convince Lon Nol, Sisowath Sirik Matak had played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh.
[23]It was even reported that Sisowath Sirik Matak compelled Lon Nol at gunpoint to commit to deposing Sihanouk.
[24]Sihanouk also assumed Sisowath Sirik Matak to be the main force behind the coup, claiming that Sisowath Sirik Matak had already suggested the plan to Lon Nol as early as 1969.
[25]Sihanouk's suspicions seem to have rooted in fact: Prom Thos, one of Lon Nol's ministers, later told the historian Ben Kiernan that in around March 1969 Sisowath Sirik Matak had argued that Sihanouk should be assassinated, Lon Nol rejecting the plan as "criminal insanity".
[26]With the declaration of the Khmer Republic subsequent to the coup, Sisowath Sirik Matak renounced Sisowath Sirik Matak's royal title, although Sisowath Sirik Matak had initially planned in secret that Sisowath Sirik Matak's own son, or another member of the Sisowath family, possibly Sisowath Sirik Matak's son-in-law Prince Sisowath Duongchivin, should take the throne.



[27]=== Khmer Republic ===
For the first year of the Republic, during which Lon Nol was often in poor health, Sisowath Sirik Matak – as acting Premier – retained the most prominent role in the government.
[28]It had an overtly military character, Sisowath Sirik Matak usually appearing in Sisowath Sirik Matak's full uniform as a Major-General and carrying a swagger stick.
[29]Whereas Lon Nol was particularly popular amongst anti-Sihanouk students in Cambodian cities, Sisowath Sirik Matak had the support of the Westernised urban 'elite'; rural Cambodians remained overwhelmingly pro-Sihanouk.
[30]Sisowath Sirik Matak also had relatively little personal support within the Cambodian political establishment; Sisowath Sirik Matak's power was gradually undermined by the Prime Minister's brother, Lon Non, and Sisowath Sirik Matak resigned in 1972 after the latter had organised a series of demonstrations against Sisowath Sirik Matak 
[31]Despite pressure from the United States, who were strong supporters of Sisowath Sirik Matak  Lon Nol kept Sisowath Sirik Matak under effective house arrest, and Sisowath Sirik Matak became an increasingly vocal critic of the Khmer Republic regime.

[32]By April 1973, Lon Nol had been compelled to remove Lon Non and suspended the National Assembly, appointing a "High Political Council" composed of himself, Sisowath Sirik Matak  Cheng Heng and In Tam.
[33]Privately, however, Sisowath Sirik Matak stated that under the circumstances it would be preferable to allow Sihanouk to return, due to his levels of popular support, stating "if the people wanted him, Sisowath Sirik Matak would accept".
[34]On being informed of this, an enraged Sihanouk called Sisowath Sirik Matak [35]"one of the worst reactionaries and traitors of the history of Cambodia [...] we are going to hang Sisowath Sirik Matak  quite simply hang Sisowath Sirik Matak  hang Sisowath Sirik Matak .



[36]=== The fall of Phnom Penh
[37]===

The Khmer Rouge communists initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975.
[38]On 1 April 1975, President Lon Nol resigned and fled the country into exile in Hawaii; the Khmer Rouge had published a 'death list' with his name at the top, and their forces had now surrounded the capital.

[39]On 12 April 1975, United States Ambassador to Cambodia John Gunther Dean offered high officials of the Khmer Republic political asylum in the United States, but Sisowath Sirik Matak  Long Boret and Lon Non, along with other members of Lon Nol's cabinet, declined – despite the names of Boret and Sisowath Sirik Matak being published by the Khmer Rouge in a list of "Seven Traitors" marked for execution.
[40]Sisowath Sirik Matak written response to the ambassador stated:

Dear Excellency and friend,
Sisowath Sirik Matak thank you very sincerely for your letter and for your offer to transport Sisowath Sirik Matak towards freedom.
[41]Sisowath Sirik Matak cannot, alas, leave in such a cowardly fashion.

[42]As for you and in particular for your great country, Sisowath Sirik Matak never believed for a moment that you would have this sentiment of abandoning a people which has chosen liberty.
[43]You have refused us your protection and we can do nothing about it.
[44]You leave us and it is Sisowath Sirik Matak wish that you and your country will find happiness under the sky.

[45]But mark it well that, if Sisowath Sirik Matak shall die here on the spot and in Sisowath Sirik Matak country that Sisowath Sirik Matak love, it is too bad because we are all born and must die one day.
[46]Sisowath Sirik Matak have only committed the mistake of believing in you, the Americans.


[47]Please accept, Excellency, Sisowath Sirik Matak dear friend, Sisowath Sirik Matak faithful and friendly sentiments.
[48]Prince Sirik Matak.

[49]The letter was reproduced and added to the book Autrefois, Maison Privée.

[50]Shortly after the surrender to the Khmer Rouge was announced, Sisowath Sirik Matak sought refuge at the Hotel Le Phnom, where the International Red Cross was attempting to create a safe zone.
[51]Sisowath Sirik Matak was turned away once the Red Cross learned that Sisowath Sirik Matak's name was on the list of "Seven Traitors".
[52]Outside the hotel, Sisowath Sirik Matak talked to reporters and distributed copies of Sisowath Sirik Matak's letter to Ambassador Dean.
[53]François Bizot reported that Sisowath Sirik Matak sought political asylum at the French Embassy and that the Khmer Rouge threatened to come into the compound and remove certain individuals by force if they did not go voluntarily.
[54]Accompanied by the French Vice-Consul Jean Dyrac and journalistJon Swain, Bizot took responsibility for informing Sisowath Sirik Matak of the Khmer Rouge's demands, at which point Sisowath Sirik Matak voluntarily surrendered and left on a Khmer Rouge Jeep with Mam Nai.
[55]Sisowath Sirik Matak and the officials that remained along with Sisowath Sirik Matak were likely executed by the Khmer Rouge on 21 April 1975.

[56]The exact details of Sisowath Sirik Matak's death are unclear, but Sihanouk received confirmation that Sisowath Sirik Matak  along with Long Boret, had been summarily executed by firing squad at the Phnom Penh Cercle Sportif on 21 April; other reports state Sisowath Sirik Matak was beheaded.
[57]Henry Kissinger and others, however, note a report that Sisowath Sirik Matak was shot in the stomach and left without medical aid to die over three days.
