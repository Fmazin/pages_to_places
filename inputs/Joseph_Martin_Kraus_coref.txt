[1]Joseph Martin Kraus (20 June 1756 – 15 December 1792), was a German-Swedish composer in the Classical era who was born in Miltenberg am Main, Germany.
[2]Joseph Martin Kraus moved to Sweden at age 21, and died at the age of 36 in Stockholm.
[3]Joseph Martin Kraus has been referred to as "the Swedish Mozart", and had a life span very similar to Mozart's.

[5]== Life ==


=== Childhood ===
Joseph Martin Kraus was born in the South German town of Miltenberg in Lower Franconia, the son of Joseph Bernhard Kraus, a county clerk in the Archbishopric of Mainz, and Anna Dorothea née Schmidt.
[6]Joseph Martin Kraus father's family, originally from Augsburg, had a small restaurant in Weilbach near Amorbach, while Joseph Martin Kraus's mother was a daughter of the master-builder at Miltenberg Johann Martin Schmidt.
[7]They had 14 children, of whom seven died in childhood; Marianne Kraus was a sister of Joseph Martin Kraus 
[8]

[9]After a short stay in Osterburken, the Kraus family moved in 1761 to Buchen (in the Odenwald), where Joseph Bernhard Kraus found a position as a clerk.
[10]Joseph Martin Kraus began Joseph Martin Kraus's formal education there.
[11]Joseph Martin Kraus first music teachers were rector Georg Pfister (1730–1807) and cantor Bernhard Franz Wendler (1702–1782), who gave Joseph Martin Kraus mainly piano and violin lessons.
[12]Joseph Martin Kraus showed Joseph Martin Kraus's musical talent at an early age.
[13]When Joseph Martin Kraus was 12, Joseph Martin Kraus was enrolled in the Jesuit Gymnasium and Music Seminar at Mannheim, where Joseph Martin Kraus studied German and Latin literature and music.
[14]There Joseph Martin Kraus received a rigorous musical training, especially in violin technique, and philological education from P. Alexander Keck (1724–1804) and P. Anton Klein (1748–1810).

[21]
Joseph Martin Kraus parents wished Joseph Martin Kraus to matriculate as a student of law at the University of Mainz in 1773.
[22]However, Joseph Martin Kraus was not satisfied with the situation at that university, and even published a satire about it.
[23]After only one year, Joseph Martin Kraus applied to the University of Erfurt, where Joseph Martin Kraus could study music too.
[24]Both Catholic and Protestant (Lutheran) music was flourishing in Erfurt, with a rich musical tradition.
[25]Joseph Martin Kraus soon neglected Joseph Martin Kraus's law studies and focused fully on music and literature.
[26]
A defamation trial against Joseph Martin Kraus's father forced Joseph Martin Kraus to interrupt Joseph Martin Kraus's studies for one year and to move back to Buchen.
[27]Joseph Martin Kraus spent Joseph Martin Kraus's time there writing Joseph Martin Kraus's three-act tragedy Tolon and several musical works for the town church of St. Oswald, including a Te Deum in D major and the motet Fracto Demum Sacramento, also in D major.
[28]After this one-year break, Joseph Martin Kraus continued Joseph Martin Kraus's studies of law in Göttingen.
[29]Although the Göttinger Hainbund (the German poet group that flourished in 1772-74) no longer existed, Joseph Martin Kraus found Joseph Martin Kraus very much attracted to the ideas of this group of young poets who were almost fanatically devoted to Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock.
[30]In this period Joseph Martin Kraus composed a recently rediscovered book of 19 poems titled Versuch von Schäfersgedichten.
[31]Joseph Martin Kraus became increasingly involved with the Sturm und Drang movement, which influenced both Joseph Martin Kraus's writing and Joseph Martin Kraus's music.
[32]

[33]In 1775, at the age of nineteen, Joseph Martin Kraus wrote Joseph Martin Kraus's Requiem, one of Joseph Martin Kraus's earliest compositions.
[34]There is no way to know for sure whether Joseph Martin Kraus was induced to compose this genre of church music for personal reasons, or whether Joseph Martin Kraus's choice may have been influenced by Joseph Martin Kraus's attraction to Sturm und Drang.
[35]The work is full of dramatic force and original, bold ideas.
[36]
The Requiem was followed by two oratorios: Der Tod Jesu and Die Geburt Jesu (lost), and the musical treatise Etwas von und über Musik: fürs Jahr 1777 (Something about Music: for the year 1777; Frankfurt am Main 1778).
[37]

[38]The oratorio Der Tod Jesu differs from the oratorios of many other composers in that Joseph Martin Kraus wrote both the music and the text.
[39]As a librettist, Joseph Martin Kraus showed a series of scenes that covered the full spectrum of human emotions, from sorrow and fear to joy.
[40]The work corresponds fully to a rhetorical question already raised in Joseph Martin Kraus treatise Etwas von und über Musik:
"Should not church music be mostly for the heart?"
("Soll die Musik in den Kirchen nicht am meisten fürs Herz sein?")

[41]During Joseph Martin Kraus's stay in Göttingen, Joseph Martin Kraus had become friendly with a Swedish fellow student, Carl Stridsberg, who persuaded Joseph Martin Kraus to accompany him to Stockholm to apply for a position at the court of King Gustav III.
[42]



[43]===
[44]At the Swedish court ===
Joseph Martin Kraus moved to Stockholm in 1778, when Joseph Martin Kraus was not yet twenty-two.
[45]Joseph Martin Kraus first years there were not easy, and more than once Joseph Martin Kraus considered going back home.
[46]King Gustav's love for the fine arts had quickly become known in the rest of Europe and attracted musicians from many countries.
[47]It took Joseph Martin Kraus three bitter years, often spent in extreme poverty, before the king noticed Joseph Martin Kraus 
[48]Joseph Martin Kraus opera Azire was rejected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, but the Academy decided to give Joseph Martin Kraus a second chance.
[49]Gustav III himself drafted the opera libretto Proserpin, which the poet Johan Henric Kellgren versified.
[50]Joseph Martin Kraus music to this libretto was successfully premiered at Ulriksdal Palace on 6 June 1781, before the king and the royal household.
[51]Joseph Martin Kraus was appointed vice-Kapellmeister of the Royal Swedish Opera and director of the Royal Academy of Music.
[52]

[53]It was the long-awaited breakthrough.
[54]Dizzy with the success, Joseph Martin Kraus wrote to Joseph Martin Kraus's parents:
"Immediately after the music ended, the king talked to Joseph Martin Kraus for more than a quarter of an hour ... it had simply given him so much satisfaction.
[55]Yesterday Joseph Martin Kraus was engaged by him.
[56]Of course Joseph Martin Kraus was not granted any great title, but quite simply that of Kapellmeister.
[57]What is worth much more to Joseph Martin Kraus than 600 guilders is the favour Joseph Martin Kraus have been granted, which is that Joseph Martin Kraus am to undertake a journey to Germany, France and Italy at the King's expense."


=== Grand Tour ===
Gustav III sent Joseph Martin Kraus on a Grand Tour of Europe that lasted five years, to learn all Joseph Martin Kraus could about Theater abroad.
[58]On this trip, Joseph Martin Kraus met Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, Padre Martini, and Joseph Haydn, for whom Joseph Martin Kraus wrote a symphony to play at Esterháza; it was first published under Haydn's name in Paris.
[59]Joseph Martin Kraus Symphonies in E minor, VB 141, and F major, VB 145, were first published in Paris in 1787, under the name of Giuseppe Cambini, a very popular composer at the time.
[60]During this time, Joseph Martin Kraus became a member of the same masonic lodge as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
[61]

[62]During Joseph Martin Kraus's journey, Joseph Martin Kraus also wrote Joseph Martin Kraus's famous flute quintet in D Major, VB 188, that broke with all the erstwhile conventions that governed such pieces.
[63]The outer and inner form of that work were groundbreaking comparing with everything previously composed at the time, with the astoundingly long first movement of 306 bars.
[64]

[65]After Vienna, Joseph Martin Kraus's journey also took Joseph Martin Kraus throughout Italy, France, and England, where Joseph Martin Kraus witnessed the Handel Centenary celebrations at Westminster Abbey in 1785.
[66]While in Paris, Joseph Martin Kraus experienced difficulty with cabals back in Stockholm that sought to prevent Joseph Martin Kraus's return, but their resolution in 1786 made it possible for Joseph Martin Kraus to become the leading figure in Gustavian musical life.
[67]



[68]===
[69]Back to Sweden ===
When Joseph Martin Kraus returned in 1787, Joseph Martin Kraus was appointed as director of curriculum at the Royal Academy of Music, and the next year Joseph Martin Kraus succeeded Francesco Uttini as Kapellmästare, eventually attaining a reputation as an innovative conductor, progressive pedagogue, and multi-talented composer.
[70]Joseph Martin Kraus also became a member of the literary circle that gathered round the Architect Erik Palmstedt (who was commissioned by King Gustav III to build the first royal opera house), a group that discussed intellectual and cultural life in the Swedish capital.
[71]

[72]For the convening of the Riksdag of the Estates in 1789, Gustav III wanted to persuade the parliament to accede to his ongoing war with Russia, where he was opposed by the nobility but supported by the burghers and the peasantry.
[73]To further his aims, Gustav III intended to secure parliamentary approval of the Act of Union and Security that would give him broad powers over the administration of the government.
[74]The king asked Joseph Martin Kraus to write Riksdagsmusiken for the opening ceremonies in St Nicolai Church on 9 March 1789.
[75]The music consists of a march based on the March of the Priests from Mozart's Idomeneo, and a symphony (Sinfonia per la chiesa).
[76]The legislature approved the king's measures.
[77]

[78]Joseph Martin Kraus wrote an overture, a march and interludes for the staging of Voltaire's Olympie in January 1792.
[79]Although Joseph Martin Kraus was considered as a composer of stage music, Joseph Martin Kraus's greatest work, Aeneas i Cartago, remained unperformed during Joseph Martin Kraus's lifetime.
[80]16 March 1792, Gustav III attended a masked ball at the opera, where he was assassinated.
[81](This inspired the plots of operas by several composers, notably Verdi's Un ballo in maschera premiered in 1859.)
[82]The death of Gustav III caused considerable turmoil in the cultural establishment that the monarch had nurtured.
[83]Joseph Martin Kraus wrote a funeral cantata and the Symphonie funèbre, which were played at the burial ceremony on April 13 and May 14.Joseph Martin Kraus own health deteriorated shortly thereafter, and Joseph Martin Kraus died in December 1792 from tuberculosis.
[84]Joseph Martin Kraus was buried outside Stockholm at Tivoli following a ceremony where Joseph Martin Kraus's coffin was carried across the ice of the Brunnsviken by torchlight.
[85]Joseph Martin Kraus tomb (c. 1833) bears the inscription: Här det jordiska af Joseph Martin Kraus  det himmelska lefver i hans toner, which translates to: Here the earthly of Joseph Martin Kraus  the heavenly lives in Joseph Martin Kraus's music

=== Works ===
Bertil H. van Boer divides Joseph Martin Kraus sacred music into two periods.
[86]The first, from 1768 to 1777, comprises Joseph Martin Kraus music written as a Roman Catholic for Catholic services.
[87]For the second, from 1778 to 1790, Joseph Martin Kraus was still Catholic, but wrote music for Lutheran services.
[88]Aside from short hymns and chorales, there was not much use for sacred music in Sweden at that time.
[89]There was also an ongoing debate regarding the role music should play in the church, and Joseph Martin Kraus participated by writing three articles on the subject in the Stockholms Posten.
[90]

[91]Two different catalogues exist of Joseph Martin Kraus music, one by Karl Schreiber, Verzeichnis der Musikalischen Werke von Joseph Martin Kraus  which gives each composition an A number, and one by Bertil van Boer's Die Werke von Joseph Martin Kraus  Systematisch-thematisches Werkverzeichnis, which gives each composition a VB number, with renumberings in the 2nd edition (1998).
[92]See the list of compositions by Joseph Martin Kraus 
[93]

[94]Bertil van Boer edited modern editions for Artaria Editions, recorded on four volumes of the Naxos Records complete set of Joseph Martin Kraus symphonies, and also wrote the programme notes for those discs as well as the article on Joseph Martin Kraus in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.
[95]Volume 1 won the Cannes Classical Award in 1999, while Volume 2 contains world première recordings of three of Joseph Martin Kraus symphonies.
[96]The orchestra Concerto Köln won several prizes for its recordings on period instruments of the complete symphonies of Joseph Martin Kraus 
[97]



[98]===
[99]Musical style ===
[100]

[101]Joseph Martin Kraus music is characterized by sudden dramatic contrasts in register, character, and most striking of all, harmony.
[102]Joseph Martin Kraus contrapuntal abilities were first-rate, but Joseph Martin Kraus's motivic development does not seem as advanced as either Mozart's or Haydn's.
[103]Compared to other contemporaries, Joseph Martin Kraus's lyrical gifts are apparent.
[104]



[105]===
[106]Joseph Martin Kraus symphonies ===
Many of Joseph Martin Kraus symphonies have been lost, or attributed to other composers.
[107]Of those definitely of Joseph Martin Kraus authorship, only about a dozen remain.
[108]Most of Joseph Martin Kraus extant symphonies are in three movements, without a minuet.
[109]Most are scored for two horns and strings, many include two flutes and two oboes, while the later ones also include two bassoons and two additional horns.
[110]The musicologist Bertil van Boer identifies Joseph Martin Kraus Symphony in C-sharp minor as "one of only two symphonies in this key written during the eighteenth century."
[111]It was later reworked in a more 'manageable' key as Symphony in C minor, VB 142.
[112]

[113]It is still disputed whether the symphony dedicated to Haydn was the Symphony in D major VB 143 or the Symphony in C minor VB 142.
[114]The minor key and the mood of Symphony VB 142 seem to be reminiscent of Haydn's Sturm und Drang period around 1770, comparable with his earlier minor-key works, although based on the first measures of Gluck's overture to Iphigénie en Aulide.
[115]In any case, Haydn had a very high opinion of the work.
[116]Many years after Joseph Martin Kraus death, Haydn remarked to a common friend, Swedish diplomat Fredrik Samuel Silverstolpe:
"The symphony Joseph Martin Kraus wrote here in Vienna especially for me will be regarded as a masterpiece for centuries to come; believe me, there are few people who can compose something like that."
[117]



[118]===
[119]Joseph Martin Kraus viola concerti ===
Joseph Martin Kraus wrote two viola concerti that were lost or attributed to other composers in Joseph Martin Kraus's lifetime.
[120]The C major Concerto was attributed to Roman Hoffstetter, but both works have been found to be Joseph Martin Kraus compositions and have been recorded professionally by David Aaron Carpenter in 2012.
